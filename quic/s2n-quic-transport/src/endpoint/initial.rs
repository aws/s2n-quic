//# The QUIC packet size includes the QUIC header and protected payload,
//# but not the UDP or IP header.
//#
//# Clients MUST ensure they send the first Initial packet in a single IP
//# packet.  Similarly, the first Initial packet sent after receiving a
//# Retry packet MUST be sent in a single IP packet.
//#
//# The payload of a UDP datagram carrying the first Initial packet MUST
//# be expanded to at least 1200 bytes, by adding PADDING frames to the
//# Initial packet and/or by coalescing the Initial packet (see
//# Section 12.2).  Sending a UDP datagram of this size ensures that the
//# network path supports a reasonable Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU),
//# and helps reduce the amplitude of amplification attacks caused by
//# server responses toward an unverified client address; see Section 8.

const MINIMUM_INITIAL_PACKET_LEN: usize = 1200;

//= https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-quic-transport-27.txt#14
//# The datagram containing the first Initial packet from a client MAY
//# exceed 1200 bytes if the client believes that the Path Maximum
//# Transmission Unit (PMTU) supports the size that it chooses.
//#
//# A server MAY send a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with error code
//# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION in response to the first Initial packet it
//# receives from a client if the UDP datagram is smaller than 1200
//# bytes.  It MUST NOT send any other frame type in response, or
//# otherwise behave as if any part of the offending packet was processed
//# as valid.
//#
//# The server MUST also limit the number of bytes it sends before
//# validating the address of the client; see Section 8.

//= https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-quic-transport-27.txt#7.2
//# A connection ID is used to ensure consistent routing of packets, as
//# described in Section 5.1.  The long header contains two connection
//# IDs: the Destination Connection ID is chosen by the recipient of the
//# packet and is used to provide consistent routing; the Source
//# Connection ID is used to set the Destination Connection ID used by
//# the peer.
//#
//# During the handshake, packets with the long header (Section 17.2) are
//# used to establish the connection ID that each endpoint uses.  Each
//# endpoint uses the Source Connection ID field to specify the
//# connection ID that is used in the Destination Connection ID field of
//# packets being sent to them.  Upon receiving a packet, each endpoint
//# sets the Destination Connection ID it sends to match the value of the
//# Source Connection ID that they receive.
//#
//# When an Initial packet is sent by a client that has not previously
//# received an Initial or Retry packet from the server, it populates the
//# Destination Connection ID field with an unpredictable value.  This
//# MUST be at least 8 bytes in length.  Until a packet is received from
//# the server, the client MUST use the same value unless it abandons the
//# connection attempt and starts a new one.  The initial Destination
//# Connection ID is used to determine packet protection keys for Initial
//# packets.

const DESTINATION_CONNECTION_ID_MIN_LEN: usize = 8;

//= https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-quic-transport-27.txt#7.2
//# The client populates the Source Connection ID field with a value of
//# its choosing and sets the SCID Len field to indicate the length.
//#
//# The first flight of 0-RTT packets use the same Destination and Source
//# Connection ID values as the client's first Initial.
//#
//# Upon first receiving an Initial or Retry packet from the server, the
//# client uses the Source Connection ID supplied by the server as the
//# Destination Connection ID for subsequent packets, including any
//# subsequent 0-RTT packets.  That means that a client might change the
//# Destination Connection ID twice during connection establishment, once
//# in response to a Retry and once in response to the first Initial
//# packet from the server.  Once a client has received an Initial packet
//# from the server, it MUST discard any packet it receives with a
//# different Source Connection ID.
//#
//# A client MUST only change the value it sends in the Destination
//# Connection ID in response to the first packet of each type it
//# receives from the server (Retry or Initial); a server MUST set its
//# value based on the Initial packet.  Any additional changes are not
//# permitted; if subsequent packets of those types include a different
//# Source Connection ID, they MUST be discarded.  This avoids problems
//# that might arise from stateless processing of multiple Initial
//# packets producing different connection IDs.
//#
//# The connection ID can change over the lifetime of a connection,
//# especially in response to connection migration (Section 9); see
//# Section 5.1.1 for details.
