//# This document specifies that the Internet provide a congestion
//# indication for incipient congestion (as in RED and earlier work
//# [RJ90]) where the notification can sometimes be through marking
//# packets rather than dropping them.  This uses an ECN field in the IP
//# header with two bits, making four ECN codepoints, '00' to '11'.  The
//# ECN-Capable Transport (ECT) codepoints '10' and '01' are set by the
//# data sender to indicate that the end-points of the transport protocol
//# are ECN-capable; we call them ECT(0) and ECT(1) respectively.  The
//# phrase "the ECT codepoint" in this documents refers to either of the
//# two ECT codepoints.  Routers treat the ECT(0) and ECT(1) codepoints
//# as equivalent.  Senders are free to use either the ECT(0) or the
//# ECT(1) codepoint to indicate ECT, on a packet-by-packet basis.
//#
//# The use of both the two codepoints for ECT, ECT(0) and ECT(1), is
//# motivated primarily by the desire to allow mechanisms for the data
//# sender to verify that network elements are not erasing the CE
//# codepoint, and that data receivers are properly reporting to the
//# sender the receipt of packets with the CE codepoint set, as required
//# by the transport protocol.  Guidelines for the senders and receivers
//# to differentiate between the ECT(0) and ECT(1) codepoints will be
//# addressed in separate documents, for each transport protocol.  In
//# particular, this document does not address mechanisms for TCP end-
//# nodes to differentiate between the ECT(0) and ECT(1) codepoints.
//# Protocols and senders that only require a single ECT codepoint SHOULD
//# use ECT(0).
//#
//# The not-ECT codepoint '00' indicates a packet that is not using ECN.
//# The CE codepoint '11' is set by a router to indicate congestion to
//# the end nodes.  Routers that have a packet arriving at a full queue
//# drop the packet, just as they do in the absence of ECN.
