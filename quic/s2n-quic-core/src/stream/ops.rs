//! Bulk operations performed on streams
//!
//! By representing stream operations as structs, callers can request multiple tasks to be
//! performed in a single call, which reduces context switching.
//!
//! Consider the following scenario where we send 3 chunks of data and finish the stream:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! stream.send(a).await?;
//! stream.send(b).await?;
//! stream.send(c).await?;
//! stream.finish().await?;
//! ```
//!
//! This will result in at least 4 context switches (and potentially even more if the stream
//! is currently blocked on sending).
//!
//! Using the bulk operation API greatly reduces this amount:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! stream
//!     .request()
//!     .send(&mut [a, b, c])
//!     .finish()
//!     .await?;
//! ```
