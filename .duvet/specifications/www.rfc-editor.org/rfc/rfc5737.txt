             IPv4 Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation

Abstract

   Three IPv4 unicast address blocks are reserved for use in examples in
   specifications and other documents.  This document describes the use
   of these blocks.

RFC 5737                     IPv4 Examples                  January 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes three IPv4 address blocks that are provided
   for use in documentation.  The use of designated address ranges for
   documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and
   confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other
   purpose.

   [RFC1166] reserves the first of the three address blocks,
   192.0.2.0/24.  The other two address blocks have recently been
   allocated for this purpose, primarily to ease the writing of examples
   involving addresses from multiple networks.

   Other documentation ranges have been defined in the IETF, including
   the IPv6 documentation prefix [RFC3849] and example domain names
   [RFC2606].  Documentation also makes use of the ranges reserved in
   [RFC1918].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

3.  Documentation Address Blocks

   The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
   and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in
   documentation.

4.  Operational Implications

   Addresses within the TEST-NET-1, TEST-NET-2, and TEST-NET-3 blocks
   SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry [RFC2050].  Network
   operators SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non-
   routeable address spaces, and if packet filters are deployed, then
   this address block SHOULD be added to packet filters.

   These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in
   both local and public contexts.

5.  The Status of 128.66.0.0/16

   Note that 128.66.0.0/16 has been used for some examples in the past.
   However, this block did not appear in the list of special prefixes in
   [RFC3330] or its successors, and the block is therefore not reserved
   for any special purpose.  The block can be used for regular address
   assignments with caution.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security implications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has recorded the allocation of the three address blocks in the
   IPv4 address registry.  No end party is to be assigned these
   addresses.
