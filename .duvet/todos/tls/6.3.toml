Endpoints responding to an apparent key update MUST NOT generate a
timing side-channel signal that might indicate that the Key Phase bit
was invalid (see Section 9.5).

An endpoint MAY
generate new keys as part of packet processing, but this creates a
timing signal that could be used by an attacker to learn when key
updates happen and thus leak the value of the Key Phase bit.

For a short period after a key
update completes, up to the PTO, endpoints MAY defer generation of
the next set of receive packet protection keys.  This allows
endpoints to retain only two sets of receive keys; see Section 6.5.

Once generated, the next set of packet protection keys SHOULD be

discarded.
