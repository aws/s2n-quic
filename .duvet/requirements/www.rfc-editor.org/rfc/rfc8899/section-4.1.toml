# PLPMTU Probe Packets
#
#    The DPLPMTUD method relies upon the PL sender being able to generate
#    probe packets with a specific size.  TCP is able to generate these
#    probe packets by choosing to appropriately segment data being sent
#    [RFC4821].  In contrast, a datagram PL that constructs a probe packet
#    has to either request an application to send a data block that is
#    larger than that generated by an application, or to utilize padding
#    functions to extend a datagram beyond the size of the application
#    data block.  Protocols that permit exchange of control messages
#    (without an application data block) can generate a probe packet by
#    extending a control message with padding data.  The total size of a
#    probe packet includes all headers and padding added to the payload
#    data being sent (e.g., including protocol option fields, security-
#    related fields such as an Authenticated Encryption with Associated
#    Data (AEAD) tag, and TLS record layer padding).
# 
#    A receiver is REQUIRED to be able to distinguish an in-band data
#    block from any added padding.  This is needed to ensure that any
#    added padding is not passed on to an application at the receiver.
# 
#    This results in three possible ways that a sender can create a probe
#    packet:
# 
#    Probing using padding data:  A probe packet that contains only
#       control information together with any padding, which is needed to
#       inflate to the size of the probe packet.  Since these probe
#       packets do not carry an application-supplied data block, they do
#       not typically require retransmission, although they do still
#       consume network capacity and incur endpoint processing.
# 
#    Probing using application data and padding data:  A probe packet that
#       contains a data block supplied by an application that is combined
#       with padding to inflate the length of the datagram to the size of
#       the probe packet.
# 
#    Probing using application data:  A probe packet that contains a data
#       block supplied by an application that matches the size of the
#       probe packet.  This method requests the application to issue a
#       data block of the desired probe size.
# 
#    A PL that uses a probe packet carrying application data and that
#    needs protection from the loss of this probe packet could perform
#    transport-layer retransmission/repair of the data block (e.g., by
#    retransmitting after loss is detected or by duplicating the data
#    block in a datagram without the padding data).  This retransmitted
#    data block might possibly need to be sent using a smaller PLPMTU,
#    which could force the PL to use a smaller packet size to traverse the
#    end-to-end path.  (This could utilize endpoint network-layer
#    fragmentation or a PL that can resegment the data block into multiple
#    datagrams).
# 
#    DPLPMTUD MAY choose to use only one of these methods to simplify the
#    implementation.
# 
#    Probe messages sent by a PL MUST contain enough information to
#    uniquely identify the probe within the Maximum Segment Lifetime
#    (e.g., including a unique identifier from the PL or the DPLPMTUD
#    implementation), while being robust to reordering and replay of probe
#    response and PTB messages.
