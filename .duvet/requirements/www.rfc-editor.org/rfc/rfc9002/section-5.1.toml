# Generating RTT Samples
#
#    An endpoint generates an RTT sample on receiving an ACK frame that
#    meets the following two conditions:
# 
#    *  the largest acknowledged packet number is newly acknowledged, and
# 
#    *  at least one of the newly acknowledged packets was ack-eliciting.
# 
#    The RTT sample, latest_rtt, is generated as the time elapsed since
#    the largest acknowledged packet was sent:
# 
#    latest_rtt = ack_time - send_time_of_largest_acked
# 
#    An RTT sample is generated using only the largest acknowledged packet
#    in the received ACK frame.  This is because a peer reports
#    acknowledgment delays for only the largest acknowledged packet in an
#    ACK frame.  While the reported acknowledgment delay is not used by
#    the RTT sample measurement, it is used to adjust the RTT sample in
#    subsequent computations of smoothed_rtt and rttvar (Section 5.3).
# 
#    To avoid generating multiple RTT samples for a single packet, an ACK
#    frame SHOULD NOT be used to update RTT estimates if it does not newly
#    acknowledge the largest acknowledged packet.
# 
#    An RTT sample MUST NOT be generated on receiving an ACK frame that
#    does not newly acknowledge at least one ack-eliciting packet.  A peer
#    usually does not send an ACK frame when only non-ack-eliciting
#    packets are received.  Therefore, an ACK frame that contains
#    acknowledgments for only non-ack-eliciting packets could include an
#    arbitrarily large ACK Delay value.  Ignoring such ACK frames avoids
#    complications in subsequent smoothed_rtt and rttvar computations.
# 
#    A sender might generate multiple RTT samples per RTT when multiple
#    ACK frames are received within an RTT.  As suggested in [RFC6298],
#    doing so might result in inadequate history in smoothed_rtt and
#    rttvar.  Ensuring that RTT estimates retain sufficient history is an
#    open research question.
