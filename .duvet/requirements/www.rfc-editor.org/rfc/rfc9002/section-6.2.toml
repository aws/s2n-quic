# Probe Timeout
#
#    A Probe Timeout (PTO) triggers the sending of one or two probe
#    datagrams when ack-eliciting packets are not acknowledged within the
#    expected period of time or the server may not have validated the
#    client's address.  A PTO enables a connection to recover from loss of
#    tail packets or acknowledgments.
# 
#    As with loss detection, the PTO is per packet number space.  That is,
#    a PTO value is computed per packet number space.
# 
#    A PTO timer expiration event does not indicate packet loss and MUST
#    NOT cause prior unacknowledged packets to be marked as lost.  When an
#    acknowledgment is received that newly acknowledges packets, loss
#    detection proceeds as dictated by the packet and time threshold
#    mechanisms; see Section 6.1.
# 
#    The PTO algorithm used in QUIC implements the reliability functions
#    of Tail Loss Probe [RFC8985], RTO [RFC5681], and F-RTO algorithms for
#    TCP [RFC5682].  The timeout computation is based on TCP's RTO period
#    [RFC6298].
