# Sending Probe Packets
#
#    When a PTO timer expires, a sender MUST send at least one ack-
#    eliciting packet in the packet number space as a probe.  An endpoint
#    MAY send up to two full-sized datagrams containing ack-eliciting
#    packets to avoid an expensive consecutive PTO expiration due to a
#    single lost datagram or to transmit data from multiple packet number
#    spaces.  All probe packets sent on a PTO MUST be ack-eliciting.
# 
#    In addition to sending data in the packet number space for which the
#    timer expired, the sender SHOULD send ack-eliciting packets from
#    other packet number spaces with in-flight data, coalescing packets if
#    possible.  This is particularly valuable when the server has both
#    Initial and Handshake data in flight or when the client has both
#    Handshake and Application Data in flight because the peer might only
#    have receive keys for one of the two packet number spaces.
# 
#    If the sender wants to elicit a faster acknowledgment on PTO, it can
#    skip a packet number to eliminate the acknowledgment delay.
# 
#    An endpoint SHOULD include new data in packets that are sent on PTO
#    expiration.  Previously sent data MAY be sent if no new data can be
#    sent.  Implementations MAY use alternative strategies for determining
#    the content of probe packets, including sending new or retransmitted
#    data based on the application's priorities.
# 
#    It is possible the sender has no new or previously sent data to send.
#    As an example, consider the following sequence of events: new
#    application data is sent in a STREAM frame, deemed lost, then
#    retransmitted in a new packet, and then the original transmission is
#    acknowledged.  When there is no data to send, the sender SHOULD send
#    a PING or other ack-eliciting frame in a single packet, rearming the
#    PTO timer.
# 
#    Alternatively, instead of sending an ack-eliciting packet, the sender
#    MAY mark any packets still in flight as lost.  Doing so avoids
#    sending an additional packet but increases the risk that loss is
#    declared too aggressively, resulting in an unnecessary rate reduction
#    by the congestion controller.
# 
#    Consecutive PTO periods increase exponentially, and as a result,
#    connection recovery latency increases exponentially as packets
#    continue to be dropped in the network.  Sending two packets on PTO
#    expiration increases resilience to packet drops, thus reducing the
#    probability of consecutive PTO events.
# 
#    When the PTO timer expires multiple times and new data cannot be
#    sent, implementations must choose between sending the same payload
#    every time or sending different payloads.  Sending the same payload
#    may be simpler and ensures the highest priority frames arrive first.
#    Sending different payloads each time reduces the chances of spurious
#    retransmission.
