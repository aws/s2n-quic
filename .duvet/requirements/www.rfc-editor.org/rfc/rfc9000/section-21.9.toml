# Peer Denial of Service
#
#    QUIC and TLS both contain frames or messages that have legitimate
#    uses in some contexts, but these frames or messages can be abused to
#    cause a peer to expend processing resources without having any
#    observable impact on the state of the connection.
# 
#    Messages can also be used to change and revert state in small or
#    inconsequential ways, such as by sending small increments to flow
#    control limits.
# 
#    If processing costs are disproportionately large in comparison to
#    bandwidth consumption or effect on state, then this could allow a
#    malicious peer to exhaust processing capacity.
# 
#    While there are legitimate uses for all messages, implementations
#    SHOULD track cost of processing relative to progress and treat
#    excessive quantities of any non-productive packets as indicative of
#    an attack.  Endpoints MAY respond to this condition with a connection
#    error or by dropping packets.
