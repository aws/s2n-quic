# Provisional Registrations
#
#    Provisional registrations of codepoints are intended to allow for
#    private use and experimentation with extensions to QUIC.  Provisional
#    registrations only require the inclusion of the codepoint value and
#    contact information.  However, provisional registrations could be
#    reclaimed and reassigned for another purpose.
# 
#    Provisional registrations require Expert Review, as defined in
#    Section 4.5 of [RFC8126].  The designated expert or experts are
#    advised that only registrations for an excessive proportion of
#    remaining codepoint space or the very first unassigned value (see
#    Section 22.1.2) can be rejected.
# 
#    Provisional registrations will include a Date field that indicates
#    when the registration was last updated.  A request to update the date
#    on any provisional registration can be made without review from the
#    designated expert(s).
# 
#    All QUIC registries include the following fields to support
#    provisional registration:
# 
#    Value:  The assigned codepoint.
#    Status:  "permanent" or "provisional".
#    Specification:  A reference to a publicly available specification for
#       the value.
#    Date:  The date of the last update to the registration.
#    Change Controller:  The entity that is responsible for the definition
#       of the registration.
#    Contact:  Contact details for the registrant.
#    Notes:  Supplementary notes about the registration.
# 
#    Provisional registrations MAY omit the Specification and Notes
#    fields, plus any additional fields that might be required for a
#    permanent registration.  The Date field is not required as part of
#    requesting a registration, as it is set to the date the registration
#    is created or updated.
