# QUIC Versions Registry
#
#    IANA has added a registry for "QUIC Versions" under a "QUIC" heading.
# 
#    The "QUIC Versions" registry governs a 32-bit space; see Section 15.
#    This registry follows the registration policy from Section 22.1.
#    Permanent registrations in this registry are assigned using the
#    Specification Required policy (Section 4.6 of [RFC8126]).
# 
#    The codepoint of 0x00000001 for the protocol is assigned with
#    permanent status to the protocol defined in this document.  The
#    codepoint of 0x00000000 is permanently reserved; the note for this
#    codepoint indicates that this version is reserved for version
#    negotiation.
# 
#    All codepoints that follow the pattern 0x?a?a?a?a are reserved, MUST
#    NOT be assigned by IANA, and MUST NOT appear in the listing of
#    assigned values.
