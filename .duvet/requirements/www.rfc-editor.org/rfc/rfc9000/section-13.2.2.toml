# Acknowledgment Frequency
#
#    A receiver determines how frequently to send acknowledgments in
#    response to ack-eliciting packets.  This determination involves a
#    trade-off.
# 
#    Endpoints rely on timely acknowledgment to detect loss; see Section 6
#    of [QUIC-RECOVERY].  Window-based congestion controllers, such as the
#    one described in Section 7 of [QUIC-RECOVERY], rely on
#    acknowledgments to manage their congestion window.  In both cases,
#    delaying acknowledgments can adversely affect performance.
# 
#    On the other hand, reducing the frequency of packets that carry only
#    acknowledgments reduces packet transmission and processing cost at
#    both endpoints.  It can improve connection throughput on severely
#    asymmetric links and reduce the volume of acknowledgment traffic
#    using return path capacity; see Section 3 of [RFC3449].
# 
#    A receiver SHOULD send an ACK frame after receiving at least two ack-
#    eliciting packets.  This recommendation is general in nature and
#    consistent with recommendations for TCP endpoint behavior [RFC5681].
#    Knowledge of network conditions, knowledge of the peer's congestion
#    controller, or further research and experimentation might suggest
#    alternative acknowledgment strategies with better performance
#    characteristics.
# 
#    A receiver MAY process multiple available packets before determining
#    whether to send an ACK frame in response.
