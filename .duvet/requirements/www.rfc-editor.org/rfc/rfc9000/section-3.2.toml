# Receiving Stream States
#
#    Figure 3 shows the states for the part of a stream that receives data
#    from a peer.  The states for a receiving part of a stream mirror only
#    some of the states of the sending part of the stream at the peer.
#    The receiving part of a stream does not track states on the sending
#    part that cannot be observed, such as the "Ready" state.  Instead,
#    the receiving part of a stream tracks the delivery of data to the
#    application, some of which cannot be observed by the sender.

#               Figure 3: States for Receiving Parts of Streams
# 
#    The receiving part of a stream initiated by a peer (types 1 and 3 for
#    a client, or 0 and 2 for a server) is created when the first STREAM,
#    STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, or RESET_STREAM frame is received for that
#    stream.  For bidirectional streams initiated by a peer, receipt of a
#    MAX_STREAM_DATA or STOP_SENDING frame for the sending part of the
#    stream also creates the receiving part.  The initial state for the
#    receiving part of a stream is "Recv".
# 
#    For a bidirectional stream, the receiving part enters the "Recv"
#    state when the sending part initiated by the endpoint (type 0 for a
#    client, type 1 for a server) enters the "Ready" state.
# 
#    An endpoint opens a bidirectional stream when a MAX_STREAM_DATA or
#    STOP_SENDING frame is received from the peer for that stream.
#    Receiving a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for an unopened stream indicates
#    that the remote peer has opened the stream and is providing flow
#    control credit.  Receiving a STOP_SENDING frame for an unopened
#    stream indicates that the remote peer no longer wishes to receive
#    data on this stream.  Either frame might arrive before a STREAM or
#    STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame if packets are lost or reordered.
# 
#    Before a stream is created, all streams of the same type with lower-
#    numbered stream IDs MUST be created.  This ensures that the creation
#    order for streams is consistent on both endpoints.
# 
#    In the "Recv" state, the endpoint receives STREAM and
#    STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames.  Incoming data is buffered and can be
#    reassembled into the correct order for delivery to the application.
#    As data is consumed by the application and buffer space becomes
#    available, the endpoint sends MAX_STREAM_DATA frames to allow the
#    peer to send more data.
# 
#    When a STREAM frame with a FIN bit is received, the final size of the
#    stream is known; see Section 4.5.  The receiving part of the stream
#    then enters the "Size Known" state.  In this state, the endpoint no
#    longer needs to send MAX_STREAM_DATA frames; it only receives any
#    retransmissions of stream data.
# 
#    Once all data for the stream has been received, the receiving part
#    enters the "Data Recvd" state.  This might happen as a result of
#    receiving the same STREAM frame that causes the transition to "Size
#    Known".  After all data has been received, any STREAM or
#    STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames for the stream can be discarded.
# 
#    The "Data Recvd" state persists until stream data has been delivered
#    to the application.  Once stream data has been delivered, the stream
#    enters the "Data Read" state, which is a terminal state.
# 
#    Receiving a RESET_STREAM frame in the "Recv" or "Size Known" state
#    causes the stream to enter the "Reset Recvd" state.  This might cause
#    the delivery of stream data to the application to be interrupted.
# 
#    It is possible that all stream data has already been received when a
#    RESET_STREAM is received (that is, in the "Data Recvd" state).
#    Similarly, it is possible for remaining stream data to arrive after
#    receiving a RESET_STREAM frame (the "Reset Recvd" state).  An
#    implementation is free to manage this situation as it chooses.
# 
#    Sending a RESET_STREAM means that an endpoint cannot guarantee
#    delivery of stream data; however, there is no requirement that stream
#    data not be delivered if a RESET_STREAM is received.  An
#    implementation MAY interrupt delivery of stream data, discard any
#    data that was not consumed, and signal the receipt of the
#    RESET_STREAM.  A RESET_STREAM signal might be suppressed or withheld
#    if stream data is completely received and is buffered to be read by
#    the application.  If the RESET_STREAM is suppressed, the receiving
#    part of the stream remains in "Data Recvd".
# 
#    Once the application receives the signal indicating that the stream
#    was reset, the receiving part of the stream transitions to the "Reset
#    Read" state, which is a terminal state.
