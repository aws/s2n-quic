# Generating Acknowledgments
#
#    Endpoints acknowledge all packets they receive and process.  However,
#    only ack-eliciting packets cause an ACK frame to be sent within the
#    maximum ack delay.  Packets that are not ack-eliciting are only
#    acknowledged when an ACK frame is sent for other reasons.
# 
#    When sending a packet for any reason, an endpoint SHOULD attempt to
#    include an ACK frame if one has not been sent recently.  Doing so
#    helps with timely loss detection at the peer.
# 
#    In general, frequent feedback from a receiver improves loss and
#    congestion response, but this has to be balanced against excessive
#    load generated by a receiver that sends an ACK frame in response to
#    every ack-eliciting packet.  The guidance offered below seeks to
#    strike this balance.
