# Stateless Reset
#
#    A stateless reset is provided as an option of last resort for an
#    endpoint that does not have access to the state of a connection.  A
#    crash or outage might result in peers continuing to send data to an
#    endpoint that is unable to properly continue the connection.  An
#    endpoint MAY send a Stateless Reset in response to receiving a packet
#    that it cannot associate with an active connection.
# 
#    A stateless reset is not appropriate for indicating errors in active
#    connections.  An endpoint that wishes to communicate a fatal
#    connection error MUST use a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame if it is able.
# 
#    To support this process, an endpoint issues a stateless reset token,
#    which is a 16-byte value that is hard to guess.  If the peer
#    subsequently receives a Stateless Reset, which is a UDP datagram that
#    ends in that stateless reset token, the peer will immediately end the
#    connection.
# 
#    A stateless reset token is specific to a connection ID.  An endpoint
#    issues a stateless reset token by including the value in the
#    Stateless Reset Token field of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.  Servers
#    can also issue a stateless_reset_token transport parameter during the
#    handshake that applies to the connection ID that it selected during
#    the handshake.  These exchanges are protected by encryption, so only
#    client and server know their value.  Note that clients cannot use the
#    stateless_reset_token transport parameter because their transport
#    parameters do not have confidentiality protection.
# 
#    Tokens are invalidated when their associated connection ID is retired
#    via a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame (Section 19.16).
# 
#    An endpoint that receives packets that it cannot process sends a
#    packet in the following layout (see Section 1.3):
# 
#    Stateless Reset {
#      Fixed Bits (2) = 1,
#      Unpredictable Bits (38..),
#      Stateless Reset Token (128),
#    }
# 
#                          Figure 10: Stateless Reset
# 
#    This design ensures that a Stateless Reset is -- to the extent
#    possible -- indistinguishable from a regular packet with a short
#    header.
# 
#    A Stateless Reset uses an entire UDP datagram, starting with the
#    first two bits of the packet header.  The remainder of the first byte
#    and an arbitrary number of bytes following it are set to values that
#    SHOULD be indistinguishable from random.  The last 16 bytes of the
#    datagram contain a stateless reset token.
# 
#    To entities other than its intended recipient, a Stateless Reset will
#    appear to be a packet with a short header.  For the Stateless Reset
#    to appear as a valid QUIC packet, the Unpredictable Bits field needs
#    to include at least 38 bits of data (or 5 bytes, less the two fixed
#    bits).
# 
#    The resulting minimum size of 21 bytes does not guarantee that a
#    Stateless Reset is difficult to distinguish from other packets if the
#    recipient requires the use of a connection ID.  To achieve that end,
#    the endpoint SHOULD ensure that all packets it sends are at least 22
#    bytes longer than the minimum connection ID length that it requests
#    the peer to include in its packets, adding PADDING frames as
#    necessary.  This ensures that any Stateless Reset sent by the peer is
#    indistinguishable from a valid packet sent to the endpoint.  An
#    endpoint that sends a Stateless Reset in response to a packet that is
#    43 bytes or shorter SHOULD send a Stateless Reset that is one byte
#    shorter than the packet it responds to.
# 
#    These values assume that the stateless reset token is the same length
#    as the minimum expansion of the packet protection AEAD.  Additional
#    unpredictable bytes are necessary if the endpoint could have
#    negotiated a packet protection scheme with a larger minimum
#    expansion.
# 
#    An endpoint MUST NOT send a Stateless Reset that is three times or
#    more larger than the packet it receives to avoid being used for
#    amplification.  Section 10.3.3 describes additional limits on
#    Stateless Reset size.
# 
#    Endpoints MUST discard packets that are too small to be valid QUIC
#    packets.  To give an example, with the set of AEAD functions defined
#    in [QUIC-TLS], short header packets that are smaller than 21 bytes
#    are never valid.
# 
#    Endpoints MUST send Stateless Resets formatted as a packet with a
#    short header.  However, endpoints MUST treat any packet ending in a
#    valid stateless reset token as a Stateless Reset, as other QUIC
#    versions might allow the use of a long header.
# 
#    An endpoint MAY send a Stateless Reset in response to a packet with a
#    long header.  Sending a Stateless Reset is not effective prior to the
#    stateless reset token being available to a peer.  In this QUIC
#    version, packets with a long header are only used during connection
#    establishment.  Because the stateless reset token is not available
#    until connection establishment is complete or near completion,
#    ignoring an unknown packet with a long header might be as effective
#    as sending a Stateless Reset.
# 
#    An endpoint cannot determine the Source Connection ID from a packet
#    with a short header; therefore, it cannot set the Destination
#    Connection ID in the Stateless Reset.  The Destination Connection ID
#    will therefore differ from the value used in previous packets.  A
#    random Destination Connection ID makes the connection ID appear to be
#    the result of moving to a new connection ID that was provided using a
#    NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame; see Section 19.15.
# 
#    Using a randomized connection ID results in two problems:
# 
#    *  The packet might not reach the peer.  If the Destination
#       Connection ID is critical for routing toward the peer, then this
#       packet could be incorrectly routed.  This might also trigger
#       another Stateless Reset in response; see Section 10.3.3.  A
#       Stateless Reset that is not correctly routed is an ineffective
#       error detection and recovery mechanism.  In this case, endpoints
#       will need to rely on other methods -- such as timers -- to detect
#       that the connection has failed.
# 
#    *  The randomly generated connection ID can be used by entities other
#       than the peer to identify this as a potential Stateless Reset.  An
#       endpoint that occasionally uses different connection IDs might
#       introduce some uncertainty about this.
# 
#    This stateless reset design is specific to QUIC version 1.  An
#    endpoint that supports multiple versions of QUIC needs to generate a
#    Stateless Reset that will be accepted by peers that support any
#    version that the endpoint might support (or might have supported
#    prior to losing state).  Designers of new versions of QUIC need to be
#    aware of this and either (1) reuse this design or (2) use a portion
#    of the packet other than the last 16 bytes for carrying data.
