# ClientHello Size
#
#    The first Initial packet from a client contains the start or all of
#    its first cryptographic handshake message, which for TLS is the
#    ClientHello.  Servers might need to parse the entire ClientHello
#    (e.g., to access extensions such as Server Name Identification (SNI)
#    or Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)) in order to decide
#    whether to accept the new incoming QUIC connection.  If the
#    ClientHello spans multiple Initial packets, such servers would need
#    to buffer the first received fragments, which could consume excessive
#    resources if the client's address has not yet been validated.  To
#    avoid this, servers MAY use the Retry feature (see Section 8.1 of
#    [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) to only buffer partial ClientHello messages from
#    clients with a validated address.
# 
#    QUIC packet and framing add at least 36 bytes of overhead to the
#    ClientHello message.  That overhead increases if the client chooses a
#    Source Connection ID field longer than zero bytes.  Overheads also do
#    not include the token or a Destination Connection ID longer than 8
#    bytes, both of which might be required if a server sends a Retry
#    packet.
# 
#    A typical TLS ClientHello can easily fit into a 1200-byte packet.
#    However, in addition to the overheads added by QUIC, there are
#    several variables that could cause this limit to be exceeded.  Large
#    session tickets, multiple or large key shares, and long lists of
#    supported ciphers, signature algorithms, versions, QUIC transport
#    parameters, and other negotiable parameters and extensions could
#    cause this message to grow.
# 
#    For servers, in addition to connection IDs and tokens, the size of
#    TLS session tickets can have an effect on a client's ability to
#    connect efficiently.  Minimizing the size of these values increases
#    the probability that clients can use them and still fit their entire
#    ClientHello message in their first Initial packet.
# 
#    The TLS implementation does not need to ensure that the ClientHello
#    is large enough to meet QUIC's requirements for datagrams that carry
#    Initial packets; see Section 14.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  QUIC
#    implementations use PADDING frames or packet coalescing to ensure
#    that datagrams are large enough.
