# Packet Reflection Attack Mitigation
#
#    A small ClientHello that results in a large block of handshake
#    messages from a server can be used in packet reflection attacks to
#    amplify the traffic generated by an attacker.
# 
#    QUIC includes three defenses against this attack.  First, the packet
#    containing a ClientHello MUST be padded to a minimum size.  Second,
#    if responding to an unverified source address, the server is
#    forbidden to send more than three times as many bytes as the number
#    of bytes it has received (see Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).
#    Finally, because acknowledgments of Handshake packets are
#    authenticated, a blind attacker cannot forge them.  Put together,
#    these defenses limit the level of amplification.
