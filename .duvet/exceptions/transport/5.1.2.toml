If the endpoint can no longer process the indicated
connection IDs, it MAY close the connection.
'''
reason = '''
Before removing a retired connection ID, s2n-quic gives the peer time to
stop using the connection ID. If after that time the peer is still using
the connection ID, s2n-quic will respond with a stateless reset instead of
closing the connection. Therefore, there is no need to proactively close the
connection when a connection ID is removed.
