Additionally, a client MAY consider the handshake to be confirmed
when it receives an acknowledgment for a 1-RTT packet.
'''
reason = '''
The optional requirement would not yield much benefits and require expensive
checks per packet received in the 1-RTT space.

The benefits would result in a quicker transition to the Handshake-confirmed
state for a Client endpoint in the event of packet loss. However, the delay
in transitioning to the Handshake-confirmed state doesn't prevent the Client
from making progress (sending application data); so the advantage is small.
