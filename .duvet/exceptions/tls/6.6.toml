Any TLS cipher suite that is specified for use with QUIC MUST define
limits on the use of the associated AEAD function that preserves
margins for confidentiality and integrity. That is, limits MUST be
specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and for
the number of packets that can fail authentication.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic does not define any cipher suites beyond what is available in the
TLS provider. In the end this means it is unenforceable by s2n-quic itself.

Future analyses and specifications MAY relax confidentiality or

No plans to implement until said future analyses have been written and evaluated.
