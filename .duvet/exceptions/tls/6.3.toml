An endpoint MAY
generate new keys as part of packet processing, but this creates a
timing signal that could be used by an attacker to learn when key
updates happen and thus leak the value of the Key Phase bit.
'''
reason = '''
We are not performing key generations as part of packet processing, so we do not
expose any timing signal to an attacker. Therefore this MAY does not apply to our
implementation.
