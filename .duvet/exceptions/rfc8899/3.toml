[[exception]]
quote = '''
Probe packets: The network interface below the PL is REQUIRED to
provide a way to transmit a probe packet that is larger than the
PLPMTU.
'''
reason = '''
This requirement pertains to the network interface s2n-quic uses,
not s2n-quic itself.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Reception feedback: The destination PL endpoint is REQUIRED to
provide a feedback method that indicates to the DPLPMTUD sender
when a probe packet has been received by the destination PL
endpoint.
'''
reason = '''
The QUIC protocol fulfills this requirement via ACK frames.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
If a probe packet
contains user data requiring retransmission in case of loss, the
PL (or layers above) is REQUIRED to arrange any retransmission
and/or repair of any resulting loss.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic PMTU probe packets do not contain user data.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Flow control
SHOULD NOT apply to DPLPMTU when probe packets use a design that
does not carry user data to the remote application.
'''
reason = '''
Flow control only applies to STREAM frames in QUIC.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Shared PLPMTU state: The PMTU value calculated from the PLPMTU
MAY also be stored with the corresponding entry associated with
the destination in the IP layer cache and used by other PL
instances.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic does not control the IP layer cache.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
*  A PL MAY be designed to segment data blocks larger than the MPS
into multiple datagrams.
'''
reason = '''
The QUIC protocol is designed to segment data blocks larger than the MPS
into multiple datagrams.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
It is RECOMMENDED that methods avoid
forcing an application to use an arbitrary small MPS for
transmission while the method is searching for the currently
supported PLPMTU.
'''
reason = '''
The QUIC protocol supports segmenting data blocks and thus does not
force the application to use any particular data block size.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
*  To assist applications in choosing a suitable data block size, the
PL is RECOMMENDED to provide a primitive that returns the MPS
derived from the PLPMTU to the higher layer using the PL.
'''
reason = '''
The QUIC protocol supports segmenting data blocks and thus does not
to assist the application in choosing any particular data block size.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
A PL sender MAY utilize similar information about the
maximum size of network-layer packet that a receiver can accept
when this is supplied (note this could be less than EMTU_R).
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic does not receive any information about the maximum size of packet
a receiver can accept.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
When the
transmission of probe packets is not controlled by the congestion
controller, the interval between probe packets MUST be at least
one RTT.
'''
reason = '''
The transmission of PMTU probe packets is controlled by the congestion
controller.
