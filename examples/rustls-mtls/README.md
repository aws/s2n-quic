# Overview
This example shows two features of s2n-quic

### mTLS
mTLS stands for "mutual TLS", and is a TLS session where both the client and the server are authenticated. This examples demonstrates a QUIC connection with mTLS.

### Event Logging
This examples also includes an example usage of a `tracing_subscriber` which dumps all events to a log file. Note that this exact implementation is unlikely to be suitable for production use since it is
- blocking IO
- very high volume (logs all events)
- doesn't rotate log files

However, it is very useful for debugging odd behaviors or failures. If you ever need to open an issue with s2n-quic, we would appreciate you including logs gathered with this mechanism.

#### Certificates
This example includes its own certificates. The `server-cert` and `client-cert` have both been signed by a Certificate Authority whose public cert is `ca-cert`.

The example certificates will be valid until 2202, but new certificates can be regenerated by running the `generate_certs.sh` script inside of the `rustls-mtls/certs` directory.
```
$ openssl x509 -in certs/client-cert.pem -text
        ...
        Validity
            Not Before: Apr 18 21:46:35 2023 GMT
            Not After : Sep 23 21:46:35 2202 GMT
        ...
```
