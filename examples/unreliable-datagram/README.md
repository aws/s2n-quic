# Unreliable Datagram

This folder contains an example of sending and receiving an 'unreliable datagram' in `s2n-quic`. An 'unreliable datagram' is data that is not retransmitted upon packet loss, and is defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9221. This is in contrast to 'stream data' which is retransmitted during packet loss. Stream data is the preferred method of sending application data, as it comes with support for features like flow control and packet retransmission. Users have the option of sending both stream data and datagram data, only datagram data, or only stream data. The default sending functionality will alternate between draining the stream queue and draining the datagram queue. Datagrams will be sent in place of stream data if the stream data queue is empty, and vice versa. Additionally, unreliable datagram users are responsible for making sure their datagrams fit into the packet space given, as packet fragmentation/assembly is not allowed. A common use-case for unreliable datagrams is video or audio streaming, where individual datagrams are small and some loss is acceptable.

# Default Datagram Implementation

`s2n-quic` contains a default implementation of the unreliable datagram sender and receiver. This implementation is minimal, given the many different ways that unreliable datagrams could be used. Users should look out for the fact that datagrams that are too large to be sent will be automatically dropped, and old datagrams will be dropped in favor of new datagrams from the peer if there is no more space on the receiving queue.

# Set-up

Currently the unreliable datagram functionality is disabled by default as it is still in development. It can be enabled by passing a compiler flag:
```sh
export RUSTFLAGS="--cfg s2n_quic_unstable"
```
and adding this line to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies]
s2n-quic = { version = "1", features = ["unstable-provider-datagram"]}
```

## Running the Example

Spin up a QUIC server that sends an unreliable datagram:

```sh
cargo run --bin datagram_sender
```

and in another shell, the client that receives that datagram:

```sh
cargo run --bin datagram_receiver
```

The receiver will print out some bytes that the server sent.

# Custom Datagram Implementation

Users can implement their own datagram sender and receiver if the default implementation doesn't work for their use-case. To do this implement the datagram Endpoint trait, and the datagram Sender and Receiver traits, found in [traits.rs](../../quic/s2n-quic-core/src/datagram/traits.rs).
