An endpoint MAY
perform this process as part of packet processing, but this creates a
timing signal that can be used by an attacker to learn when key
updates happen and thus the value of the Key Phase bit in certain
packets.
'''
reason = '''
We are not performing key generations as part of packet processing, so we do not
expose any timing signal to an attacker. Therefore this MAY does not apply to our
implementation.
