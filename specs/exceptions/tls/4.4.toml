A server MAY request that the client authenticate during the
handshake.  A server MAY refuse a connection if the client is unable
to authenticate when requested.
'''
reason = '''
The requirements for client
authentication vary based on application protocol and deployment.

s2n-quic doesn't need to do anything specific, as this is only handled
in the application layer.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (as
defined in Section 4.6.2 of [TLS13]), because the multiplexing
offered by QUIC prevents clients from correlating the certificate
request with the application-level event that triggered it (see
[HTTP2-TLS13]).  More specifically, servers MUST NOT send post-
handshake TLS CertificateRequest messages and clients MUST treat
receipt of such messages as a connection error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic doesn't actually inspect any TLS messages so this will need
to be enforced by the TLS layer.
