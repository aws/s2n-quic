quote = '''
A connection MAY use the delay between sending a PATH_CHALLENGE and
receiving a PATH_RESPONSE to set the initial RTT (see kInitialRtt in
Appendix A.2) for a new path, but the delay SHOULD NOT be considered
an RTT sample.
'''
reason = '''
There isn't much benefit from doing this since the initial RTT is
discarded after the first RTT sample.
