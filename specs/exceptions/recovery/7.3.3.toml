quote = '''
A sender in congestion avoidance uses an Additive Increase
Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) approach that MUST limit the increase
to the congestion window to at most one maximum datagram size for
each congestion window that is acknowledged.
'''
reason = '''
The default congestion controller is CUBIC and not NewReno,
and CUBIC does not specify this limit. However, the Linux implementation
of CUBIC does limit the congestion window increase to 1 packet for
2 packets acked. The s2n-QUIC implementation of CUBIC follows the Linux
implementation by limiting the increase on each ACK to half the acked bytes.
