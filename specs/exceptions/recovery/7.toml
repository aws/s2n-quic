quote = '''
If a sender uses a different controller than that specified in this
document, the chosen controller MUST conform to the congestion
control guidelines specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC8085].
'''
reason = '''
The default CUBIC congestion controller is similar to the NewReno controller
specified. Alternative congestion controllers can be provided and should
conform to the guidelines. Ultimately, this means this requirement cannot
be guaranteed by s2n-quic alone.
