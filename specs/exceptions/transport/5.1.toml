Connection IDs MUST NOT contain any information that can be used by
an external observer (that is, one that does not cooperate with the
issuer) to correlate them with other connection IDs for the same
connection.

reason = '''
While the default provider in s2n-quic generates completely random connection IDs,
an alternative provider can be provided and should ensure this is true. Ultimately,
this means this requirement cannot be guaranteed by s2n-quic alone.

endpoint MUST NOT use the same IP address and port for multiple

that those protocol features are not in use.

Zero-length connection IDs generated on an s2n-QUIC endpoint are not supported
