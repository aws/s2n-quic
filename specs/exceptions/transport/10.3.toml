quote = '''
An endpoint MAY send a stateless reset in response to a packet with a
long header.
'''
reason = '''
Because the stateless reset token is not available
until connection establishment is complete or near completion,
ignoring an unknown packet with a long header might be as effective
as sending a stateless reset.
