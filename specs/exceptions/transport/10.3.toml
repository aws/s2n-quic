quote = '''
An endpoint MAY send a Stateless Reset in response to a packet with a
long header.
'''
reason = '''
Because the stateless reset token is not available
until connection establishment is complete or near completion,
ignoring an unknown packet with a long header might be as effective
as sending a stateless reset.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
An
endpoint that sends a Stateless Reset in response to a packet that is
43 bytes or shorter SHOULD send a Stateless Reset that is one byte
shorter than the packet it responds to.
'''
reason = '''
The stateless resets that s2n-quic sends are always smaller than the packet
it responds to. The size is randomly determined between the smallest value
that is indistinguishable from a valid short packet and the size of the triggering
packet. This is sufficient to prevent stateless reset looping.
