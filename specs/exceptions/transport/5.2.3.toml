quote = '''
A server in a deployment that does not implement a solution to
maintain connection continuity when the client address changes SHOULD
indicate migration is not supported using the
disable_active_migration transport parameter.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic does not require a particular deployment strategy, which makes
this requirement unenforceable.

quote = '''
Server deployments that use this simple form of load balancing MUST
avoid the creation of a stateless reset oracle; see Section 21.10.
'''
reason = '''
Both the connection ID and retry tokens are implemented through providers
which means this requirement is unenforceable by s2n-quic alone.
