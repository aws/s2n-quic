The same stateless reset token MUST NOT be used for multiple

quote = '''
This method for
choosing the stateless reset token means that the combination of
connection ID and static key MUST NOT be used for another connection.

reason = '''
s2n-quic always requests a new connection ID for each connection, but since
connection IDs are implemented through a provider this requirement is
unenforceable.

A connection ID from a
connection that is reset by revealing the stateless reset token MUST
NOT be reused for new connections at nodes that share a static key.
