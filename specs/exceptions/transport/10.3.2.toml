quote = '''
This method for
choosing the stateless reset token means that the combination of
connection ID and static key MUST NOT be used for another connection.

connection IDs are implemented through a provider this requirement is
unenforceable.

A connection ID from a
connection that is reset by revealing the stateless reset token MUST
