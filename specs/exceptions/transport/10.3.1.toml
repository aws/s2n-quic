The endpoint identifies a received datagram as a Stateless Reset by comparing the
last 16 bytes of the datagram with all stateless reset tokens
associated with the remote address on which the datagram was
received.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic maintains a hash map of all Stateless Reset Tokens to the connection
they are associated with. Since the hash map provides constant time lookups by
using SipHash initialized with random state, it is not necessary to use remote
address to reduce the potential pool of matching Stateless Reset Tokens before
performing the comparison. In addition, validating the remote address matches the
remote address associated with the Stateless Reset Token provides minimal additional
security benefit given the ease of spoofing remote addresses and the difficult of
forging a valid Stateless Reset Token.
