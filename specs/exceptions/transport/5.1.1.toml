If an endpoint provided fewer connection IDs than the
peer's active_connection_id_limit, it MAY supply a new connection ID
when it receives a packet with a previously unused connection ID.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-QUIC proactively supplies connection IDs up to the minimum of the
peer's active_connection_id_limit and a hardcoded MAX_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_ID_LIMIT,
so the maximum amount of  connection IDs will already be issued by the time a
peer uses them.
