quote = '''
If an endpoint provided fewer connection IDs than the
peer's active_connection_id_limit, it MAY supply a new connection ID
when it receives a packet with a previously unused connection ID.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic proactively supplies connection IDs up to the minimum of the
peer's active_connection_id_limit and a hardcoded MAX_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_ID_LIMIT,
so the maximum amount of  connection IDs will already be issued by the time a
peer uses them.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
An
endpoint MAY limit the total number of connection IDs issued for each
connection to avoid the risk of running out of connection IDs; see
Section 10.3.2.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic requires connection ID providers to provide connection IDs of at
least 4 bytes in length, which allows for at least 4 billion possible connection
IDs. s2n-quic allows limits the number of concurrent connection IDs issued,
as well as their minimum lifetime, so the risk of running out of connection IDs
is sufficiently mitigated.
