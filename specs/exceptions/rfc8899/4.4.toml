To avoid
this, a PL MAY be designed to segment data blocks larger than the MPS
into multiple datagrams.
'''
reason = '''
The QUIC protocol is designed to segment data blocks larger than the MPS
into multiple datagrams.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
To determine the largest data block that can be sent,
a PL SHOULD provide applications with a primitive that returns the
MPS, derived from the current PLPMTU.
'''
reason = '''
The QUIC protocol supports segmenting data blocks and thus does not
limit the application to any particular data block size.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
If these packets are lost, the PL MAY segment
the data using the new MPS.
'''
reason = '''
s2n-quic reconstructs lost packets by notifying each component of the
lost packet number and retransmitting with newly written frames. This
will result in a new packet that is clamped to the new MPS.
