If an endpoint sends a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a datagram that is not
expanded to at least 1200 bytes and if the response to it validates
the peer address, the path is validated but not the path MTU.

reason = '''
s2n-quic rounds up path validation frames to 1200 bytes so MTU is
always validated as part of path validation.

However, the endpoint MUST initiate
another path validation with an expanded datagram to verify that the
path supports the required MTU.
