# 6.5.  Receiving with Different Keys
#
# For receiving packets during a key update, packets protected with
# older keys might arrive if they were delayed by the network.
# Retaining old packet protection keys allows these packets to be
# successfully processed.
# 
# As packets protected with keys from the next key phase use the same
# Key Phase value as those protected with keys from the previous key
# phase, it can be necessary to distinguish between the two.  This can
# be done using packet numbers.  A recovered packet number that is
# lower than any packet number from the current key phase uses the
# previous packet protection keys; a recovered packet number that is
# higher than any packet number from the current key phase requires the
# use of the next packet protection keys.
# 
# Some care is necessary to ensure that any process for selecting
# between previous, current, and next packet protection keys does not
# expose a timing side channel that might reveal which keys were used
# to remove packet protection.  See Section 9.5 for more information.
# 
# Alternatively, endpoints can retain only two sets of packet
# protection keys, swapping previous for next after enough time has
# passed to allow for reordering in the network.  In this case, the Key
# Phase bit alone can be used to select keys.
# 
# An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout
# (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after receiving a packet that uses the new
# key generation before it creates the next set of packet protection
# keys.  These updated keys MAY replace the previous keys at that time.
# With the caveat that PTO is a subjective measure - that is, a peer
# could have a different view of the RTT - this time is expected to be
# long enough that any reordered packets would be declared lost by a
# peer even if they were acknowledged and short enough to allow for
# subsequent key updates.
# 
# Endpoints need to allow for the possibility that a peer might not be
# able to decrypt packets that initiate a key update during the period
# when it retains old keys.  Endpoints SHOULD wait three times the PTO
# before initiating a key update after receiving an acknowledgment that
# confirms that the previous key update was received.  Failing to allow
# sufficient time could lead to packets being discarded.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD retain old read keys for no more than three times
# the PTO after having received a packet protected using the new keys.
# After this period, old read keys and their corresponding secrets
# SHOULD be discarded.
