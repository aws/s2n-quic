# 4.9.  Discarding Unused Keys
#
# After QUIC moves to a new encryption level, packet protection keys
# for previous encryption levels can be discarded.  This occurs several
# times during the handshake, as well as when keys are updated; see
# Section 6.
# 
# Packet protection keys are not discarded immediately when new keys
# are available.  If packets from a lower encryption level contain
# CRYPTO frames, frames that retransmit that data MUST be sent at the
# same encryption level.  Similarly, an endpoint generates
# acknowledgements for packets at the same encryption level as the
# packet being acknowledged.  Thus, it is possible that keys for a
# lower encryption level are needed for a short time after keys for a
# newer encryption level are available.
# 
# An endpoint cannot discard keys for a given encryption level unless
# it has both received and acknowledged all CRYPTO frames for that
# encryption level and when all CRYPTO frames for that encryption level
# have been acknowledged by its peer.  However, this does not guarantee
# that no further packets will need to be received or sent at that
# encryption level because a peer might not have received all the
# acknowledgements necessary to reach the same state.
# 
# Though an endpoint might retain older keys, new data MUST be sent at
# the highest currently-available encryption level.  Only ACK frames
# and retransmissions of data in CRYPTO frames are sent at a previous
# encryption level.  These packets MAY also include PADDING frames.
