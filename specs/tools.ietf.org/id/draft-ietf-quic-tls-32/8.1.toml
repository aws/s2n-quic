# 8.1.  Protocol Negotiation
#
# QUIC requires that the cryptographic handshake provide authenticated
# protocol negotiation.  TLS uses Application Layer Protocol
# Negotiation ([ALPN]) to select an application protocol.  Unless
# another mechanism is used for agreeing on an application protocol,
# endpoints MUST use ALPN for this purpose.
# 
# When using ALPN, endpoints MUST immediately close a connection (see
# Section 10.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) with a no_application_protocol TLS
# alert (QUIC error code 0x178; see Section 4.8) if an application
# protocol is not negotiated.  While [ALPN] only specifies that servers
# use this alert, QUIC clients MUST use error 0x178 to terminate a
# connection when ALPN negotiation fails.
# 
# An application protocol MAY restrict the QUIC versions that it can
# operate over.  Servers MUST select an application protocol compatible
# with the QUIC version that the client has selected.  The server MUST
# treat the inability to select a compatible application protocol as a
# connection error of type 0x178 (no_application_protocol).  Similarly,
# a client MUST treat the selection of an incompatible application
# protocol by a server as a connection error of type 0x178.
