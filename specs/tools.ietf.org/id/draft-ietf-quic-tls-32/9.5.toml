# 9.5.  Header Protection Timing Side-Channels
#
# An attacker could guess values for packet numbers or Key Phase and
# have an endpoint confirm guesses through timing side channels.
# Similarly, guesses for the packet number length can be tried and
# exposed.  If the recipient of a packet discards packets with
# duplicate packet numbers without attempting to remove packet
# protection they could reveal through timing side-channels that the
# packet number matches a received packet.  For authentication to be
# free from side-channels, the entire process of header protection
# removal, packet number recovery, and packet protection removal MUST
# be applied together without timing and other side-channels.
# 
# For the sending of packets, construction and protection of packet
# payloads and packet numbers MUST be free from side-channels that
# would reveal the packet number or its encoded size.
# 
# During a key update, the time taken to generate new keys could reveal
# through timing side-channels that a key update has occurred.
# Alternatively, where an attacker injects packets this side-channel
# could reveal the value of the Key Phase on injected packets.  After
# receiving a key update, an endpoint SHOULD generate and save the next
# set of receive packet protection keys, as described in Section 6.3.
# 
# By generating new keys before a key update is received, receipt of
# packets will not create timing signals that leak the value of the Key
# Phase.
# 
# This depends on not doing this key generation during packet
# processing and it can require that endpoints maintain three sets of
# packet protection keys for receiving: for the previous key phase, for
# the current key phase, and for the next key phase.  Endpoints can
# instead choose to defer generation of the next receive packet
# protection keys until they discard old keys so that only two sets of
# receive keys need to be retained at any point in time.
