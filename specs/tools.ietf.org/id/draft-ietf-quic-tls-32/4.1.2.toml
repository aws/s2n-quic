# 4.1.2.  Handshake Confirmed
#
# In this document, the TLS handshake is considered confirmed at the
# server when the handshake completes.  At the client, the handshake is
# considered confirmed when a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame is received.
# 
# A client MAY consider the handshake to be confirmed when it receives
# an acknowledgement for a 1-RTT packet.  This can be implemented by
# recording the lowest packet number sent with 1-RTT keys, and
# comparing it to the Largest Acknowledged field in any received 1-RTT
# ACK frame: once the latter is greater than or equal to the former,
# the handshake is confirmed.
