# 8.2.  QUIC Transport Parameters Extension
#
# QUIC transport parameters are carried in a TLS extension.  Different
# versions of QUIC might define a different method for negotiating
# transport configuration.
# 
# Including transport parameters in the TLS handshake provides
# integrity protection for these values.
# 
#    enum {
#       quic_transport_parameters(0xffa5), (65535)
#    } ExtensionType;
# 
# The extension_data field of the quic_transport_parameters extension
# contains a value that is defined by the version of QUIC that is in
# use.
# 
# The quic_transport_parameters extension is carried in the ClientHello
# and the EncryptedExtensions messages during the handshake.  Endpoints
# MUST send the quic_transport_parameters extension; endpoints that
# receive ClientHello or EncryptedExtensions messages without the
# 
# quic_transport_parameters extension MUST close the connection with an
# error of type 0x16d (equivalent to a fatal TLS missing_extension
# alert, see Section 4.8).
# 
# While the transport parameters are technically available prior to the
# completion of the handshake, they cannot be fully trusted until the
# handshake completes, and reliance on them should be minimized.
# However, any tampering with the parameters will cause the handshake
# to fail.
# 
# Endpoints MUST NOT send this extension in a TLS connection that does
# not use QUIC (such as the use of TLS with TCP defined in [TLS13]).  A
# fatal unsupported_extension alert MUST be sent by an implementation
# that supports this extension if the extension is received when the
# transport is not QUIC.
