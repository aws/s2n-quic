# 6.2.3.  Speeding Up Handshake Completion
#
# When a server receives an Initial packet containing duplicate CRYPTO
# data, it can assume the client did not receive all of the server's
# CRYPTO data sent in Initial packets, or the client's estimated RTT is
# too small.  When a client receives Handshake or 1-RTT packets prior
# to obtaining Handshake keys, it may assume some or all of the
# server's Initial packets were lost.
# 
# To speed up handshake completion under these conditions, an endpoint
# MAY, for a limited number of occasions per each connection, send a
# packet containing unacknowledged CRYPTO data earlier than the PTO
# expiry, subject to the address validation limits in Section 8.1 of
# [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Doing so at most once for each connection is
# adequate to quickly recover from a single packet loss.  Endpoints
# that do not cease retransmitting packets in response to
# unauthenticated data risk creating an infinite exchange of packets.
# 
# Endpoints can also use coalesced packets (see Section 12.2 of
# [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) to ensure that each datagram elicits at least one
# acknowledgement.  For example, a client can coalesce an Initial
# packet containing PING and PADDING frames with a 0-RTT data packet
# and a server can coalesce an Initial packet containing a PING frame
# with one or more packets in its first flight.
