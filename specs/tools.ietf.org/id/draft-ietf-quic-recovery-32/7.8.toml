# 7.8.  Under-utilizing the Congestion Window
#
# When bytes in flight is smaller than the congestion window and
# sending is not pacing limited, the congestion window is under-
# utilized.  When this occurs, the congestion window SHOULD NOT be
# increased in either slow start or congestion avoidance.  This can
# happen due to insufficient application data or flow control limits.
# 
# A sender that paces packets (see Section 7.7) might delay sending
# packets and not fully utilize the congestion window due to this
# delay.  A sender SHOULD NOT consider itself application limited if it
# would have fully utilized the congestion window without pacing delay.
# 
# A sender MAY implement alternative mechanisms to update its
# congestion window after periods of under-utilization, such as those
# proposed for TCP in [RFC7661].
