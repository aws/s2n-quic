# 7.2.  Initial and Minimum Congestion Window
#
# QUIC begins every connection in slow start with the congestion window
# set to an initial value.  Endpoints SHOULD use an initial congestion
# window of 10 times the maximum datagram size (max_datagram_size),
# limited to the larger of 14720 bytes or twice the maximum datagram
# size.  This follows the analysis and recommendations in [RFC6928],
# increasing the byte limit to account for the smaller 8 byte overhead
# of UDP compared to the 20 byte overhead for TCP.
# 
# If the maximum datagram size changes during the connection, the
# initial congestion window SHOULD be recalculated with the new size.
# If the maximum datagram size is decreased in order to complete the
# handshake, the congestion window SHOULD be set to the new initial
# congestion window.
# 
# Prior to validating the client's address, the server can be further
# limited by the anti-amplification limit as specified in Section 8.1
# of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Though the anti-amplification limit can prevent
# the congestion window from being fully utilized and therefore slow
# down the increase in congestion window, it does not directly affect
# the congestion window.
# 
# The minimum congestion window is the smallest value the congestion
# window can decrease to as a response to loss, increase in the peer-
# reported ECN-CE count, or persistent congestion.  The RECOMMENDED
# value is 2 * max_datagram_size.
