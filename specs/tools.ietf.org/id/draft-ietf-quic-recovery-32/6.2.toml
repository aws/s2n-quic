# 6.2.  Probe Timeout
#
# A Probe Timeout (PTO) triggers sending one or two probe datagrams
# when ack-eliciting packets are not acknowledged within the expected
# period of time or the server may not have validated the client's
# address.  A PTO enables a connection to recover from loss of tail
# packets or acknowledgements.
# 
# As with loss detection, the probe timeout is per packet number space.
# That is, a PTO value is computed per packet number space.
# 
# A PTO timer expiration event does not indicate packet loss and MUST
# NOT cause prior unacknowledged packets to be marked as lost.  When an
# acknowledgement is received that newly acknowledges packets, loss
# detection proceeds as dictated by packet and time threshold
# mechanisms; see Section 6.1.
# 
# The PTO algorithm used in QUIC implements the reliability functions
# of Tail Loss Probe [RACK], RTO [RFC5681], and F-RTO algorithms for
# TCP [RFC5682].  The timeout computation is based on TCP's
# retransmission timeout period [RFC6298].
