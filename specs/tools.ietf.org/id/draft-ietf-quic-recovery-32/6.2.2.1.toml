# 6.2.2.1.  Before Address Validation
#
# Until the server has validated the client's address on the path, the
# amount of data it can send is limited to three times the amount of
# data received, as specified in Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  If
# no additional data can be sent, the server's PTO timer MUST NOT be
# armed until datagrams have been received from the client, because
# packets sent on PTO count against the anti-amplification limit.  Note
# that the server could fail to validate the client's address even if
# 0-RTT is accepted.
# 
# Since the server could be blocked until more datagrams are received
# from the client, it is the client's responsibility to send packets to
# unblock the server until it is certain that the server has finished
# its address validation (see Section 8 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  That is,
# the client MUST set the probe timer if the client has not received an
# acknowledgement for one of its Handshake packets and the handshake is
# not confirmed (see Section 4.1.2 of [QUIC-TLS]), even if there are no
# packets in flight.  When the PTO fires, the client MUST send a
# Handshake packet if it has Handshake keys, otherwise it MUST send an
# Initial packet in a UDP datagram with a payload of at least 1200
# bytes.
