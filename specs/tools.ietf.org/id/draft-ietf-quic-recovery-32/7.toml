# 7.  Congestion Control
#
# This document specifies a sender-side congestion controller for QUIC
# similar to TCP NewReno ([RFC6582]).
# 
# The signals QUIC provides for congestion control are generic and are
# designed to support different sender-side algorithms.  A sender can
# unilaterally choose a different algorithm to use, such as Cubic
# ([RFC8312]).
# 
# If a sender uses a different controller than that specified in this
# document, the chosen controller MUST conform to the congestion
# control guidelines specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC8085].
# 
# Similar to TCP, packets containing only ACK frames do not count
# towards bytes in flight and are not congestion controlled.  Unlike
# TCP, QUIC can detect the loss of these packets and MAY use that
# information to adjust the congestion controller or the rate of ACK-
# only packets being sent, but this document does not describe a
# mechanism for doing so.
# 
# The algorithm in this document specifies and uses the controller's
# congestion window in bytes.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT send a packet if it would cause bytes_in_flight
# (see Appendix B.2) to be larger than the congestion window, unless
# the packet is sent on a PTO timer expiration (see Section 6.2) or
# when entering recovery (see Section 7.3.2).
