# 6.1.  Acknowledgement-Based Detection
#
# Acknowledgement-based loss detection implements the spirit of TCP's
# Fast Retransmit ([RFC5681]), Early Retransmit ([RFC5827]), FACK
# ([FACK]), SACK loss recovery ([RFC6675]), and RACK ([RACK]).  This
# section provides an overview of how these algorithms are implemented
# in QUIC.
# 
# A packet is declared lost if it meets all the following conditions:
# 
# *  The packet is unacknowledged, in-flight, and was sent prior to an
#    acknowledged packet.
# 
# *  The packet was sent kPacketThreshold packets before an
#    acknowledged packet (Section 6.1.1), or it was sent long enough in
#    the past (Section 6.1.2).
# 
# The acknowledgement indicates that a packet sent later was delivered,
# and the packet and time thresholds provide some tolerance for packet
# reordering.
# 
# Spuriously declaring packets as lost leads to unnecessary
# retransmissions and may result in degraded performance due to the
# actions of the congestion controller upon detecting loss.
# Implementations can detect spurious retransmissions and increase the
# reordering threshold in packets or time to reduce future spurious
# retransmissions and loss events.  Implementations with adaptive time
# thresholds MAY choose to start with smaller initial reordering
# thresholds to minimize recovery latency.
