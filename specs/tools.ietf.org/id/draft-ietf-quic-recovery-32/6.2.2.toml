# 6.2.2.  Handshakes and New Paths
#
# Resumed connections over the same network MAY use the previous
# connection's final smoothed RTT value as the resumed connection's
# initial RTT.  When no previous RTT is available, the initial RTT
# SHOULD be set to 333ms, resulting in a 1 second initial timeout, as
# recommended in [RFC6298].
# 
# A connection MAY use the delay between sending a PATH_CHALLENGE and
# receiving a PATH_RESPONSE to set the initial RTT (see kInitialRtt in
# Appendix A.2) for a new path, but the delay SHOULD NOT be considered
# an RTT sample.
# 
# Initial packets and Handshake packets could be never acknowledged,
# but they are removed from bytes in flight when the Initial and
# Handshake keys are discarded, as described below in Section 6.4.
# When Initial or Handshake keys are discarded, the PTO and loss
# detection timers MUST be reset, because discarding keys indicates
# forward progress and the loss detection timer might have been set for
# a now discarded packet number space.
