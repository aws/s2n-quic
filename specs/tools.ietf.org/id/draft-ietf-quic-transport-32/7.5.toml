# 7.5.  Cryptographic Message Buffering
#
# Implementations need to maintain a buffer of CRYPTO data received out
# of order.  Because there is no flow control of CRYPTO frames, an
# endpoint could potentially force its peer to buffer an unbounded
# amount of data.
# 
# Implementations MUST support buffering at least 4096 bytes of data
# received in out-of-order CRYPTO frames.  Endpoints MAY choose to
# allow more data to be buffered during the handshake.  A larger limit
# during the handshake could allow for larger keys or credentials to be
# exchanged.  An endpoint's buffer size does not need to remain
# constant during the life of the connection.
# 
# Being unable to buffer CRYPTO frames during the handshake can lead to
# a connection failure.  If an endpoint's buffer is exceeded during the
# handshake, it can expand its buffer temporarily to complete the
# handshake.  If an endpoint does not expand its buffer, it MUST close
# the connection with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.
# 
# Once the handshake completes, if an endpoint is unable to buffer all
# data in a CRYPTO frame, it MAY discard that CRYPTO frame and all
# CRYPTO frames received in the future, or it MAY close the connection
# with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.  Packets containing
# discarded CRYPTO frames MUST be acknowledged because the packet has
# been received and processed by the transport even though the CRYPTO
# frame was discarded.
