# 5.1.2.  Consuming and Retiring Connection IDs
#
# An endpoint can change the connection ID it uses for a peer to
# another available one at any time during the connection.  An endpoint
# consumes connection IDs in response to a migrating peer; see
# Section 9.5 for more.
# 
# An endpoint maintains a set of connection IDs received from its peer,
# any of which it can use when sending packets.  When the endpoint
# wishes to remove a connection ID from use, it sends a
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame to its peer.  Sending a
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame indicates that the connection ID will not
# be used again and requests that the peer replace it with a new
# connection ID using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.
# 
# As discussed in Section 9.5, endpoints limit the use of a connection
# ID to packets sent from a single local address to a single
# destination address.  Endpoints SHOULD retire connection IDs when
# they are no longer actively using either the local or destination
# address for which the connection ID was used.
# 
# An endpoint might need to stop accepting previously issued connection
# IDs in certain circumstances.  Such an endpoint can cause its peer to
# retire connection IDs by sending a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with an
# increased Retire Prior To field.  The endpoint SHOULD continue to
# accept the previously issued connection IDs until they are retired by
# the peer.  If the endpoint can no longer process the indicated
# connection IDs, it MAY close the connection.
# 
# Upon receipt of an increased Retire Prior To field, the peer MUST
# stop using the corresponding connection IDs and retire them with
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames before adding the newly provided
# connection ID to the set of active connection IDs.  This ordering
# allows an endpoint to replace all active connection IDs without the
# 
# possibility of a peer having no available connection IDs and without
# exceeding the limit the peer sets in the active_connection_id_limit
# transport parameter; see Section 18.2.  Failure to cease using the
# connection IDs when requested can result in connection failures, as
# the issuing endpoint might be unable to continue using the connection
# IDs with the active connection.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD limit the number of connection IDs it has retired
# locally and have not yet been acknowledged.  An endpoint SHOULD allow
# for sending and tracking a number of RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames of
# at least twice the active_connection_id limit.  An endpoint MUST NOT
# forget a connection ID without retiring it, though it MAY choose to
# treat having connection IDs in need of retirement that exceed this
# limit as a connection error of type CONNECTION_ID_LIMIT_ERROR.
# 
# Endpoints SHOULD NOT issue updates of the Retire Prior To field
# before receiving RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames that retire all
# connection IDs indicated by the previous Retire Prior To value.
