# 17.2.5.  Retry Packet
#
# A Retry packet uses a long packet header with a type value of 0x3.
# It carries an address validation token created by the server.  It is
# used by a server that wishes to perform a retry; see Section 8.1.
# 
# Retry Packet {
#   Header Form (1) = 1,
#   Fixed Bit (1) = 1,
#   Long Packet Type (2) = 3,
#   Unused (4),
#   Version (32),
#   Destination Connection ID Length (8),
#   Destination Connection ID (0..160),
#   Source Connection ID Length (8),
#   Source Connection ID (0..160),
#   Retry Token (..),
#   Retry Integrity Tag (128),
# }
# 
#                        Figure 18: Retry Packet
# 
# A Retry packet (shown in Figure 18) does not contain any protected
# fields.  The value in the Unused field is set to an arbitrary value
# by the server; a client MUST ignore these bits.  In addition to the
# fields from the long header, it contains these additional fields:
# 
# Retry Token:  An opaque token that the server can use to validate the
#    client's address.
# 
# Retry Integrity Tag:  See the Retry Packet Integrity section of
#    [QUIC-TLS].
