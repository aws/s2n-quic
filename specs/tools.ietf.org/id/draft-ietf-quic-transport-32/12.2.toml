# 12.2.  Coalescing Packets
#
# Initial (Section 17.2.2), 0-RTT (Section 17.2.3), and Handshake
# (Section 17.2.4) packets contain a Length field that determines the
# end of the packet.  The length includes both the Packet Number and
# Payload fields, both of which are confidentiality protected and
# initially of unknown length.  The length of the Payload field is
# learned once header protection is removed.
# 
# Using the Length field, a sender can coalesce multiple QUIC packets
# into one UDP datagram.  This can reduce the number of UDP datagrams
# needed to complete the cryptographic handshake and start sending
# data.  This can also be used to construct PMTU probes; see
# Section 14.4.1.  Receivers MUST be able to process coalesced packets.
# 
# Coalescing packets in order of increasing encryption levels (Initial,
# 0-RTT, Handshake, 1-RTT; see Section 4.1.4 of [QUIC-TLS]) makes it
# more likely the receiver will be able to process all the packets in a
# single pass.  A packet with a short header does not include a length,
# so it can only be the last packet included in a UDP datagram.  An
# endpoint SHOULD include multiple frames in a single packet if they
# are to be sent at the same encryption level, instead of coalescing
# multiple packets at the same encryption level.
# 
# Receivers MAY route based on the information in the first packet
# contained in a UDP datagram.  Senders MUST NOT coalesce QUIC packets
# with different connection IDs into a single UDP datagram.  Receivers
# SHOULD ignore any subsequent packets with a different Destination
# Connection ID than the first packet in the datagram.
# 
# Every QUIC packet that is coalesced into a single UDP datagram is
# separate and complete.  The receiver of coalesced QUIC packets MUST
# individually process each QUIC packet and separately acknowledge
# them, as if they were received as the payload of different UDP
# datagrams.  For example, if decryption fails (because the keys are
# not available or any other reason), the receiver MAY either discard
# or buffer the packet for later processing and MUST attempt to process
# the remaining packets.
# 
# Retry packets (Section 17.2.5), Version Negotiation packets
# (Section 17.2.1), and packets with a short header (Section 17.3) do
# not contain a Length field and so cannot be followed by other packets
# in the same UDP datagram.  Note also that there is no situation where
# a Retry or Version Negotiation packet is coalesced with another
# packet.
