# 9.2.  Initiating Connection Migration
#
# An endpoint can migrate a connection to a new local address by
# sending packets containing non-probing frames from that address.
# 
# Each endpoint validates its peer's address during connection
# establishment.  Therefore, a migrating endpoint can send to its peer
# knowing that the peer is willing to receive at the peer's current
# address.  Thus an endpoint can migrate to a new local address without
# first validating the peer's address.
# 
# To establish reachability on the new path, an endpoint initiates path
# validation (Section 8.2) on the new path.  An endpoint MAY defer path
# validation until after a peer sends the next non-probing frame to its
# new address.
# 
# When migrating, the new path might not support the endpoint's current
# sending rate.  Therefore, the endpoint resets its congestion
# controller and RTT estimate, as described in Section 9.4.
# 
# The new path might not have the same ECN capability.  Therefore, the
# endpoint validates ECN capability as described in Section 13.4.
