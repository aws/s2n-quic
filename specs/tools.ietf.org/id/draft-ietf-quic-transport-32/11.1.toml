# 11.1.  Connection Errors
#
# Errors that result in the connection being unusable, such as an
# obvious violation of protocol semantics or corruption of state that
# affects an entire connection, MUST be signaled using a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame (Section 19.19).
# 
# Application-specific protocol errors are signaled using the
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a frame type of 0x1d.  Errors that are
# specific to the transport, including all those described in this
# document, are carried in the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a frame type
# of 0x1c.
# 
# A CONNECTION_CLOSE frame could be sent in a packet that is lost.  An
# endpoint SHOULD be prepared to retransmit a packet containing a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame if it receives more packets on a terminated
# connection.  Limiting the number of retransmissions and the time over
# which this final packet is sent limits the effort expended on
# terminated connections.
# 
# An endpoint that chooses not to retransmit packets containing a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame risks a peer missing the first such packet.
# The only mechanism available to an endpoint that continues to receive
# data for a terminated connection is to use the stateless reset
# process (Section 10.3).
