# 9.3.  Responding to Connection Migration
#
# Receiving a packet from a new peer address containing a non-probing
# frame indicates that the peer has migrated to that address.
# 
# If the recipient permits the migration, it MUST send subsequent
# packets to the new peer address and MUST initiate path validation
# (Section 8.2) to verify the peer's ownership of the address if
# validation is not already underway.
# 
# An endpoint only changes the address to which it sends packets in
# response to the highest-numbered non-probing packet.  This ensures
# that an endpoint does not send packets to an old peer address in the
# case that it receives reordered packets.
# 
# An endpoint MAY send data to an unvalidated peer address, but it MUST
# protect against potential attacks as described in Section 9.3.1 and
# Section 9.3.2.  An endpoint MAY skip validation of a peer address if
# that address has been seen recently.  In particular, if an endpoint
# returns to a previously-validated path after detecting some form of
# spurious migration, skipping address validation and restoring loss
# detection and congestion state can reduce the performance impact of
# the attack.
# 
# After changing the address to which it sends non-probing packets, an
# endpoint can abandon any path validation for other addresses.
# 
# Receiving a packet from a new peer address could be the result of a
# NAT rebinding at the peer.
# 
# After verifying a new client address, the server SHOULD send new
# address validation tokens (Section 8) to the client.
