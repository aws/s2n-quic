# 5.1.  Connection ID
#
# Each connection possesses a set of connection identifiers, or
# connection IDs, each of which can identify the connection.
# Connection IDs are independently selected by endpoints; each endpoint
# selects the connection IDs that its peer uses.
# 
# The primary function of a connection ID is to ensure that changes in
# addressing at lower protocol layers (UDP, IP) do not cause packets
# for a QUIC connection to be delivered to the wrong endpoint.  Each
# endpoint selects connection IDs using an implementation-specific (and
# perhaps deployment-specific) method that will allow packets with that
# connection ID to be routed back to the endpoint and to be identified
# by the endpoint upon receipt.
# 
# Connection IDs MUST NOT contain any information that can be used by
# an external observer (that is, one that does not cooperate with the
# issuer) to correlate them with other connection IDs for the same
# connection.  As a trivial example, this means the same connection ID
# MUST NOT be issued more than once on the same connection.
# 
# Packets with long headers include Source Connection ID and
# Destination Connection ID fields.  These fields are used to set the
# connection IDs for new connections; see Section 7.2 for details.
# 
# Packets with short headers (Section 17.3) only include the
# Destination Connection ID and omit the explicit length.  The length
# of the Destination Connection ID field is expected to be known to
# endpoints.  Endpoints using a load balancer that routes based on
# connection ID could agree with the load balancer on a fixed length
# for connection IDs, or agree on an encoding scheme.  A fixed portion
# could encode an explicit length, which allows the entire connection
# ID to vary in length and still be used by the load balancer.
# 
# A Version Negotiation (Section 17.2.1) packet echoes the connection
# IDs selected by the client, both to ensure correct routing toward the
# client and to demonstrate that the packet is in response to a packet
# sent by the client.
# 
# A zero-length connection ID can be used when a connection ID is not
# needed to route to the correct endpoint.  However, multiplexing
# connections on the same local IP address and port while using zero-
# length connection IDs will cause failures in the presence of peer
# connection migration, NAT rebinding, and client port reuse.  An
# endpoint MUST NOT use the same IP address and port for multiple
# connections with zero-length connection IDs, unless it is certain
# that those protocol features are not in use.
# 
# When an endpoint uses a non-zero-length connection ID, it needs to
# ensure that the peer has a supply of connection IDs from which to
# choose for packets sent to the endpoint.  These connection IDs are
# supplied by the endpoint using the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame
# (Section 19.15).
