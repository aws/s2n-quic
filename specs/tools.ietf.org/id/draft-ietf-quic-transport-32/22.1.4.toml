# 22.1.4.  Permanent Registrations
#
# Permanent registrations in QUIC registries use the Specification
# Required policy ([RFC8126]), unless otherwise specified.  The
# designated expert(s) verify that a specification exists and is
# readily accessible.  Expert(s) are encouraged to be biased towards
# approving registrations unless they are abusive, frivolous, or
# actively harmful (not merely aesthetically displeasing, or
# architecturally dubious).  The creation of a registry MAY specify
# additional constraints on permanent registrations.
# 
# The creation of a registry MAY identify a range of codepoints where
# registrations are governed by a different registration policy.  For
# instance, the registries for 62-bit codepoints in this document have
# stricter policies for codepoints in the range from 0 to 63.
# 
# Any stricter requirements for permanent registrations do not prevent
# provisional registrations for affected codepoints.  For instance, a
# provisional registration for a frame type (Section 22.3) of 61 could
# be requested.
# 
# All registrations made by Standards Track publications MUST be
# permanent.
# 
# All registrations in this document are assigned a permanent status
# and list a change controller of the IETF and a contact of the QUIC
# working group (quic@ietf.org).
