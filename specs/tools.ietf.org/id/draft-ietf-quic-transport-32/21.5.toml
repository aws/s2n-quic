# 21.5.  Slowloris Attacks
#
# The attacks commonly known as Slowloris ([SLOWLORIS]) try to keep
# many connections to the target endpoint open and hold them open as
# long as possible.  These attacks can be executed against a QUIC
# endpoint by generating the minimum amount of activity necessary to
# avoid being closed for inactivity.  This might involve sending small
# amounts of data, gradually opening flow control windows in order to
# control the sender rate, or manufacturing ACK frames that simulate a
# high loss rate.
# 
# QUIC deployments SHOULD provide mitigations for the Slowloris
# attacks, such as increasing the maximum number of clients the server
# will allow, limiting the number of connections a single IP address is
# allowed to make, imposing restrictions on the minimum transfer speed
# a connection is allowed to have, and restricting the length of time
# an endpoint is allowed to stay connected.
