# 19.7.  NEW_TOKEN Frames
#
# A server sends a NEW_TOKEN frame (type=0x07) to provide the client
# with a token to send in the header of an Initial packet for a future
# connection.
# 
# NEW_TOKEN frames are formatted as shown in Figure 31.
# 
# NEW_TOKEN Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x07,
#   Token Length (i),
#   Token (..),
# }
# 
#                   Figure 31: NEW_TOKEN Frame Format
# 
# NEW_TOKEN frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Token Length:  A variable-length integer specifying the length of the
#    token in bytes.
# 
# Token:  An opaque blob that the client may use with a future Initial
#    packet.  The token MUST NOT be empty.  An endpoint MUST treat
#    receipt of a NEW_TOKEN frame with an empty Token field as a
#    connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.
# 
# An endpoint might receive multiple NEW_TOKEN frames that contain the
# same token value if packets containing the frame are incorrectly
# determined to be lost.  Endpoints are responsible for discarding
# duplicate values, which might be used to link connection attempts;
# see Section 8.1.3.
# 
# Clients MUST NOT send NEW_TOKEN frames.  Servers MUST treat receipt
# of a NEW_TOKEN frame as a connection error of type
# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
