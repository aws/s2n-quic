# 8.2.1.  Initiating Path Validation
#
# To initiate path validation, an endpoint sends a PATH_CHALLENGE frame
# containing an unpredictable payload on the path to be validated.
# 
# An endpoint MAY send multiple PATH_CHALLENGE frames to guard against
# packet loss.  However, an endpoint SHOULD NOT send multiple
# PATH_CHALLENGE frames in a single packet.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD NOT probe a new path with packets containing a
# PATH_CHALLENGE frame more frequently than it would send an Initial
# packet.  This ensures that connection migration is no more load on a
# new path than establishing a new connection.
# 
# The endpoint MUST use unpredictable data in every PATH_CHALLENGE
# frame so that it can associate the peer's response with the
# corresponding PATH_CHALLENGE.
# 
# An endpoint MUST expand datagrams that contain a PATH_CHALLENGE frame
# to at least the smallest allowed maximum datagram size of 1200 bytes.
# Sending UDP datagrams of this size ensures that the network path from
# the endpoint to the peer can be used for QUIC; see Section 14.
