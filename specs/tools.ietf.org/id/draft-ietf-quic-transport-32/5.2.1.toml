# 5.2.1.  Client Packet Handling
#
# Valid packets sent to clients always include a Destination Connection
# ID that matches a value the client selects.  Clients that choose to
# receive zero-length connection IDs can use the local address and port
# to identify a connection.  Packets that do not match an existing
# connection, based on Destination Connection ID or, if this value is
# zero-length, local IP address and port, are discarded.
# 
# Due to packet reordering or loss, a client might receive packets for
# a connection that are encrypted with a key it has not yet computed.
# The client MAY drop these packets, or MAY buffer them in anticipation
# of later packets that allow it to compute the key.
# 
# If a client receives a packet that uses a different version than it
# initially selected, it MUST discard that packet.
