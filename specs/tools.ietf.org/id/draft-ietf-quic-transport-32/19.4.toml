# 19.4.  RESET_STREAM Frames
#
# An endpoint uses a RESET_STREAM frame (type=0x04) to abruptly
# terminate the sending part of a stream.
# 
# After sending a RESET_STREAM, an endpoint ceases transmission and
# retransmission of STREAM frames on the identified stream.  A receiver
# of RESET_STREAM can discard any data that it already received on that
# stream.
# 
# An endpoint that receives a RESET_STREAM frame for a send-only stream
# MUST terminate the connection with error STREAM_STATE_ERROR.
# 
# RESET_STREAM frames are formatted as shown in Figure 28.
# 
# RESET_STREAM Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x04,
#   Stream ID (i),
#   Application Protocol Error Code (i),
#   Final Size (i),
# }
# 
#                  Figure 28: RESET_STREAM Frame Format
# 
# RESET_STREAM frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Stream ID:  A variable-length integer encoding of the Stream ID of
#    the stream being terminated.
# 
# Application Protocol Error Code:  A variable-length integer
#    containing the application protocol error code (see Section 20.2)
#    that indicates why the stream is being closed.
# 
# Final Size:  A variable-length integer indicating the final size of
#    the stream by the RESET_STREAM sender, in unit of bytes; see
#    Section 4.5.
