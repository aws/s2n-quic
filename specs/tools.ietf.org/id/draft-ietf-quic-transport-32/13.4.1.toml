# 13.4.1.  Reporting ECN Counts
#
# Use of ECN requires the receiving endpoint to read the ECN field from
# an IP packet, which is not possible on all platforms.  If an endpoint
# does not implement ECN support or does not have access to received
# ECN fields, it does not report ECN counts for packets it receives.
# 
# Even if an endpoint does not set an ECT field on packets it sends,
# the endpoint MUST provide feedback about ECN markings it receives, if
# these are accessible.  Failing to report the ECN counts will cause
# the sender to disable use of ECN for this connection.
# 
# On receiving an IP packet with an ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE codepoint, an
# ECN-enabled endpoint accesses the ECN field and increases the
# corresponding ECT(0), ECT(1), or CE count.  These ECN counts are
# included in subsequent ACK frames; see Section 13.2 and Section 19.3.
# 
# Each packet number space maintains separate acknowledgement state and
# separate ECN counts.  Coalesced QUIC packets (see Section 12.2) share
# the same IP header so the ECN counts are incremented once for each
# coalesced QUIC packet.
# 
# For example, if one each of an Initial, Handshake, and 1-RTT QUIC
# packet are coalesced into a single UDP datagram, the ECN counts for
# all three packet number spaces will be incremented by one each, based
# on the ECN field of the single IP header.
# 
# ECN counts are only incremented when QUIC packets from the received
# IP packet are processed.  As such, duplicate QUIC packets are not
# processed and do not increase ECN counts; see Section 21.9 for
# relevant security concerns.
