# 17.2.5.1.  Sending a Retry Packet
#
# The server populates the Destination Connection ID with the
# connection ID that the client included in the Source Connection ID of
# the Initial packet.
# 
# The server includes a connection ID of its choice in the Source
# Connection ID field.  This value MUST NOT be equal to the Destination
# Connection ID field of the packet sent by the client.  A client MUST
# discard a Retry packet that contains a Source Connection ID field
# that is identical to the Destination Connection ID field of its
# Initial packet.  The client MUST use the value from the Source
# Connection ID field of the Retry packet in the Destination Connection
# ID field of subsequent packets that it sends.
# 
# A server MAY send Retry packets in response to Initial and 0-RTT
# packets.  A server can either discard or buffer 0-RTT packets that it
# receives.  A server can send multiple Retry packets as it receives
# Initial or 0-RTT packets.  A server MUST NOT send more than one Retry
# packet in response to a single UDP datagram.
