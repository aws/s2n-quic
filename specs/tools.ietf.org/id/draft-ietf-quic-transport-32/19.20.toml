# 19.20.  HANDSHAKE_DONE Frames
#
# The server uses a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame (type=0x1e) to signal
# confirmation of the handshake to the client.
# 
# HANDSHAKE_DONE frames are formatted as shown in Figure 44, which
# shows that HANDSHAKE_DONE frames have no content.
# 
# HANDSHAKE_DONE Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x1e,
# }
# 
#                 Figure 44: HANDSHAKE_DONE Frame Format
# 
# A HANDSHAKE_DONE frame can only be sent by the server.  Servers MUST
# NOT send a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame before completing the handshake.  A
# server MUST treat receipt of a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame as a connection
# error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
