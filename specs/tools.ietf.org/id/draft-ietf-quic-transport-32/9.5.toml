# 9.5.  Privacy Implications of Connection Migration
#
# Using a stable connection ID on multiple network paths would allow a
# passive observer to correlate activity between those paths.  An
# endpoint that moves between networks might not wish to have their
# activity correlated by any entity other than their peer, so different
# connection IDs are used when sending from different local addresses,
# as discussed in Section 5.1.  For this to be effective, endpoints
# need to ensure that connection IDs they provide cannot be linked by
# any other entity.
# 
# At any time, endpoints MAY change the Destination Connection ID they
# transmit with to a value that has not been used on another path.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending from more
# than one local address, for example when initiating connection
# migration as described in Section 9.2 or when probing a new network
# path as described in Section 9.1.
# 
# Similarly, an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending to
# more than one destination address.  Due to network changes outside
# the control of its peer, an endpoint might receive packets from a new
# source address with the same destination connection ID, in which case
# it MAY continue to use the current connection ID with the new remote
# address while still sending from the same local address.
# 
# These requirements regarding connection ID reuse apply only to the
# sending of packets, as unintentional changes in path without a change
# in connection ID are possible.  For example, after a period of
# network inactivity, NAT rebinding might cause packets to be sent on a
# new path when the client resumes sending.  An endpoint responds to
# such an event as described in Section 9.3.
# 
# Using different connection IDs for packets sent in both directions on
# each new network path eliminates the use of the connection ID for
# linking packets from the same connection across different network
# paths.  Header protection ensures that packet numbers cannot be used
# to correlate activity.  This does not prevent other properties of
# packets, such as timing and size, from being used to correlate
# activity.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD NOT initiate migration with a peer that has
# requested a zero-length connection ID, because traffic over the new
# path might be trivially linkable to traffic over the old one.  If the
# server is able to associate packets with a zero-length connection ID
# to the right connection, it means that the server is using other
# information to demultiplex packets.  For example, a server might
# provide a unique address to every client, for instance using HTTP
# alternative services [ALTSVC].  Information that might allow correct
# routing of packets across multiple network paths will also allow
# activity on those paths to be linked by entities other than the peer.
# 
# A client might wish to reduce linkability by employing a new
# connection ID and source UDP port when sending traffic after a period
# of inactivity.  Changing the UDP port from which it sends packets at
# the same time might cause the packet to appear as a connection
# migration.  This ensures that the mechanisms that support migration
# are exercised even for clients that do not experience NAT rebindings
# or genuine migrations.  Changing port number can cause a peer to
# reset its congestion state (see Section 9.4), so the port SHOULD only
# be changed infrequently.
# 
# An endpoint that exhausts available connection IDs cannot probe new
# paths or initiate migration, nor can it respond to probes or attempts
# by its peer to migrate.  To ensure that migration is possible and
# packets sent on different paths cannot be correlated, endpoints
# SHOULD provide new connection IDs before peers migrate; see
# Section 5.1.1.  If a peer might have exhausted available connection
# IDs, a migrating endpoint could include a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame in
# all packets sent on a new network path.
