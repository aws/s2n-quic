# 17.2.5.2.  Handling a Retry Packet
#
# A client MUST accept and process at most one Retry packet for each
# connection attempt.  After the client has received and processed an
# Initial or Retry packet from the server, it MUST discard any
# subsequent Retry packets that it receives.
# 
# Clients MUST discard Retry packets that have a Retry Integrity Tag
# that cannot be validated; see the Retry Packet Integrity section of
# [QUIC-TLS].  This diminishes an off-path attacker's ability to inject
# a Retry packet and protects against accidental corruption of Retry
# packets.  A client MUST discard a Retry packet with a zero-length
# Retry Token field.
# 
# The client responds to a Retry packet with an Initial packet that
# includes the provided Retry Token to continue connection
# establishment.
# 
# A client sets the Destination Connection ID field of this Initial
# packet to the value from the Source Connection ID in the Retry
# packet.  Changing Destination Connection ID also results in a change
# to the keys used to protect the Initial packet.  It also sets the
# Token field to the token provided in the Retry.  The client MUST NOT
# change the Source Connection ID because the server could include the
# connection ID as part of its token validation logic; see
# Section 8.1.4.
# 
# A Retry packet does not include a packet number and cannot be
# explicitly acknowledged by a client.
