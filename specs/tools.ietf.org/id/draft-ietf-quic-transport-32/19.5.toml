# 19.5.  STOP_SENDING Frames
#
# An endpoint uses a STOP_SENDING frame (type=0x05) to communicate that
# incoming data is being discarded on receipt at application request.
# STOP_SENDING requests that a peer cease transmission on a stream.
# 
# A STOP_SENDING frame can be sent for streams in the Recv or Size
# Known states; see Section 3.1.  Receiving a STOP_SENDING frame for a
# locally-initiated stream that has not yet been created MUST be
# treated as a connection error of type STREAM_STATE_ERROR.  An
# endpoint that receives a STOP_SENDING frame for a receive-only stream
# MUST terminate the connection with error STREAM_STATE_ERROR.
# 
# STOP_SENDING frames are formatted as shown in Figure 29.
# 
# STOP_SENDING Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x05,
#   Stream ID (i),
#   Application Protocol Error Code (i),
# }
# 
#                  Figure 29: STOP_SENDING Frame Format
# 
# STOP_SENDING frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Stream ID:  A variable-length integer carrying the Stream ID of the
# 
#    stream being ignored.
# 
# Application Protocol Error Code:  A variable-length integer
#    containing the application-specified reason the sender is ignoring
#    the stream; see Section 20.2.
