# 22.1.3.  Reclaiming Provisional Codepoints
#
# A request might be made to remove an unused provisional registration
# from the registry to reclaim space in a registry, or portion of the
# registry (such as the 64-16383 range for codepoints that use
# variable-length encodings).  This SHOULD be done only for the
# codepoints with the earliest recorded date and entries that have been
# updated less than a year prior SHOULD NOT be reclaimed.
# 
# A request to remove a codepoint MUST be reviewed by the designated
# expert(s).  The expert(s) MUST attempt to determine whether the
# codepoint is still in use.  Experts are advised to contact the listed
# contacts for the registration, plus as wide a set of protocol
# implementers as possible in order to determine whether any use of the
# codepoint is known.  The expert(s) are advised to allow at least four
# weeks for responses.
# 
# If any use of the codepoints is identified by this search or a
# request to update the registration is made, the codepoint MUST NOT be
# reclaimed.  Instead, the date on the registration is updated.  A note
# might be added for the registration recording relevant information
# that was learned.
# 
# If no use of the codepoint was identified and no request was made to
# update the registration, the codepoint MAY be removed from the
# registry.
# 
# This process also applies to requests to change a provisional
# registration into a permanent registration, except that the goal is
# not to determine whether there is no use of the codepoint, but to
# determine that the registration is an accurate representation of any
# deployed usage.
