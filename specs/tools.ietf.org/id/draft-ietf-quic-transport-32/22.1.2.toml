# 22.1.2.  Selecting Codepoints
#
# New uses of codepoints from QUIC registries SHOULD use a randomly
# selected codepoint that excludes both existing allocations and the
# first unallocated codepoint in the selected space.  Requests for
# multiple codepoints MAY use a contiguous range.  This minimizes the
# risk that differing semantics are attributed to the same codepoint by
# different implementations.  Use of the first codepoint in a range is
# intended for use by specifications that are developed through the
# standards process [STD] and its allocation MUST be negotiated with
# IANA before use.
# 
# For codepoints that are encoded in variable-length integers
# (Section 16), such as frame types, codepoints that encode to four or
# eight bytes (that is, values 2^14 and above) SHOULD be used unless
# the usage is especially sensitive to having a longer encoding.
# 
# Applications to register codepoints in QUIC registries MAY include a
# codepoint as part of the registration.  IANA MUST allocate the
# selected codepoint unless that codepoint is already assigned or the
# codepoint is the first unallocated codepoint in the registry.
