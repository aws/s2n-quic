# 9.4.  Loss Detection and Congestion Control
#
# The capacity available on the new path might not be the same as the
# old path.  Packets sent on the old path MUST NOT contribute to
# congestion control or RTT estimation for the new path.
# 
# On confirming a peer's ownership of its new address, an endpoint MUST
# immediately reset the congestion controller and round-trip time
# estimator for the new path to initial values (see Appendices A.3 and
# B.3 in [QUIC-RECOVERY]) unless the only change in the peer's address
# is its port number.  Because port-only changes are commonly the
# result of NAT rebinding or other middlebox activity, the endpoint MAY
# instead retain its congestion control state and round-trip estimate
# in those cases instead of reverting to initial values.  In cases
# where congestion control state retained from an old path is used on a
# new path with substantially different characteristics, a sender may
# transmit too aggressively until the congestion controller and the RTT
# estimator have adapted.  Generally, implementations are advised to be
# cautious when using previous values on a new path.
# 
# There may be apparent reordering at the receiver when an endpoint
# sends data and probes from/to multiple addresses during the migration
# period, since the two resulting paths may have different round-trip
# times.  A receiver of packets on multiple paths will still send ACK
# frames covering all received packets.
# 
# While multiple paths might be used during connection migration, a
# single congestion control context and a single loss recovery context
# (as described in [QUIC-RECOVERY]) may be adequate.  For instance, an
# endpoint might delay switching to a new congestion control context
# until it is confirmed that an old path is no longer needed (such as
# the case in Section 9.3.3).
# 
# A sender can make exceptions for probe packets so that their loss
# detection is independent and does not unduly cause the congestion
# controller to reduce its sending rate.  An endpoint might set a
# separate timer when a PATH_CHALLENGE is sent, which is cancelled if
# the corresponding PATH_RESPONSE is received.  If the timer fires
# before the PATH_RESPONSE is received, the endpoint might send a new
# PATH_CHALLENGE, and restart the timer for a longer period of time.
# This timer SHOULD be set as described in Section 6.2.1 of
# [QUIC-RECOVERY] and MUST NOT be more aggressive.
