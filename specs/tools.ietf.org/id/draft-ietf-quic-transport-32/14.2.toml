# 14.2.  Path Maximum Transmission Unit
#
# The Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) is the maximum size of the
# entire IP packet including the IP header, UDP header, and UDP
# payload.  The UDP payload includes one or more QUIC packet headers
# and protected payloads.  The PMTU can depend on path characteristics,
# and can therefore change over time.  The largest UDP payload an
# endpoint sends at any given time is referred to as the endpoint's
# maximum datagram size.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD use DPLPMTUD (Section 14.3) or PMTUD
# (Section 14.2.1) to determine whether the path to a destination will
# support a desired maximum datagram size without fragmentation.  In
# the absence of these mechanisms, QUIC endpoints SHOULD NOT send
# datagrams larger than the smallest allowed maximum datagram size.
# 
# Both DPLPMTUD and PMTUD send datagrams that are larger than the
# current maximum datagram size, referred to as PMTU probes.  All QUIC
# packets that are not sent in a PMTU probe SHOULD be sized to fit
# within the maximum datagram size to avoid the datagram being
# fragmented or dropped ([RFC8085]).
# 
# If a QUIC endpoint determines that the PMTU between any pair of local
# and remote IP addresses has fallen below the smallest allowed maximum
# datagram size of 1200 bytes, it MUST immediately cease sending QUIC
# packets, except for those in PMTU probes or those containing
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frames, on the affected path.  An endpoint MAY
# terminate the connection if an alternative path cannot be found.
# 
# Each pair of local and remote addresses could have a different PMTU.
# QUIC implementations that implement any kind of PMTU discovery
# therefore SHOULD maintain a maximum datagram size for each
# combination of local and remote IP addresses.
# 
# A QUIC implementation MAY be more conservative in computing the
# maximum datagram size to allow for unknown tunnel overheads or IP
# header options/extensions.
