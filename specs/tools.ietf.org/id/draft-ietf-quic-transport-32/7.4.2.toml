# 7.4.2.  New Transport Parameters
#
# New transport parameters can be used to negotiate new protocol
# behavior.  An endpoint MUST ignore transport parameters that it does
# not support.  Absence of a transport parameter therefore disables any
# optional protocol feature that is negotiated using the parameter.  As
# described in Section 18.1, some identifiers are reserved in order to
# exercise this requirement.
# 
# A client that does not understand a transport parameter can discard
# it and attempt 0-RTT on subsequent connections.  However, if the
# client adds support for a discarded transport parameter, it risks
# violating the constraints that the transport parameter establishes if
# it attempts 0-RTT.  New transport parameters can avoid this problem
# by setting a default of the most conservative value.
# 
# New transport parameters can be registered according to the rules in
# Section 22.2.
