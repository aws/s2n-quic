# 9.  Connection Migration
#
# The use of a connection ID allows connections to survive changes to
# endpoint addresses (IP address and port), such as those caused by an
# endpoint migrating to a new network.  This section describes the
# process by which an endpoint migrates to a new address.
# 
# The design of QUIC relies on endpoints retaining a stable address for
# the duration of the handshake.  An endpoint MUST NOT initiate
# connection migration before the handshake is confirmed, as defined in
# section 4.1.2 of [QUIC-TLS].
# 
# If the peer sent the disable_active_migration transport parameter, an
# endpoint also MUST NOT send packets (including probing packets; see
# Section 9.1) from a different local address to the address the peer
# used during the handshake, unless the endpoint has acted on a
# preferred_address transport parameter from the peer.  If the peer
# violates this requirement, the endpoint MUST either drop the incoming
# packets on that path without generating a stateless reset or proceed
# with path validation and allow the peer to migrate.  Generating a
# 
# stateless reset or closing the connection would allow third parties
# in the network to cause connections to close by spoofing or otherwise
# manipulating observed traffic.
# 
# Not all changes of peer address are intentional, or active,
# migrations.  The peer could experience NAT rebinding: a change of
# address due to a middlebox, usually a NAT, allocating a new outgoing
# port or even a new outgoing IP address for a flow.  An endpoint MUST
# perform path validation (Section 8.2) if it detects any change to a
# peer's address, unless it has previously validated that address.
# 
# When an endpoint has no validated path on which to send packets, it
# MAY discard connection state.  An endpoint capable of connection
# migration MAY wait for a new path to become available before
# discarding connection state.
# 
# This document limits migration of connections to new client
# addresses, except as described in Section 9.6.  Clients are
# responsible for initiating all migrations.  Servers do not send non-
# probing packets (see Section 9.1) toward a client address until they
# see a non-probing packet from that address.  If a client receives
# packets from an unknown server address, the client MUST discard these
# packets.
