# 13.2.  Generating Acknowledgements
#
# Endpoints acknowledge all packets they receive and process.  However,
# only ack-eliciting packets cause an ACK frame to be sent within the
# maximum ack delay.  Packets that are not ack-eliciting are only
# acknowledged when an ACK frame is sent for other reasons.
# 
# When sending a packet for any reason, an endpoint SHOULD attempt to
# include an ACK frame if one has not been sent recently.  Doing so
# helps with timely loss detection at the peer.
# 
# In general, frequent feedback from a receiver improves loss and
# congestion response, but this has to be balanced against excessive
# load generated by a receiver that sends an ACK frame in response to
# every ack-eliciting packet.  The guidance offered below seeks to
# strike this balance.
