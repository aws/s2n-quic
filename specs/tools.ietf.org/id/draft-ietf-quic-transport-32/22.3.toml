# 22.3.  QUIC Frame Types Registry
#
# IANA [SHALL add/has added] a registry for "QUIC Frame Types" under a
# "QUIC" heading.
# 
# The "QUIC Frame Types" registry governs a 62-bit space.  This
# registry follows the registration policy from Section 22.1.
# Permanent registrations in this registry are assigned using the
# Specification Required policy ([RFC8126]), except for values between
# 0x00 and 0x3f (in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using
# Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in Section 4.9 and 4.10
# of [RFC8126].
# 
# In addition to the fields in Section 22.1.1, permanent registrations
# in this registry MUST include the following field:
# 
# Frame Name:  A short mnemonic for the frame type.
# 
# In addition to the advice in Section 22.1, specifications for new
# permanent registrations SHOULD describe the means by which an
# endpoint might determine that it can send the identified type of
# frame.  An accompanying transport parameter registration is expected
# for most registrations; see Section 22.2.  Specifications for
# permanent registrations also need to describe the format and assigned
# semantics of any fields in the frame.
# 
# The initial contents of this registry are tabulated in Table 3.  Note
# that the registry does not include the "Pkts" and "Spec" columns from
# Table 3.
