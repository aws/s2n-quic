# 10.1.  Idle Timeout
#
# If a max_idle_timeout is specified by either peer in its transport
# parameters (Section 18.2), the connection is silently closed and its
# state is discarded when it remains idle for longer than the minimum
# of both peers max_idle_timeout values.
# 
# Each endpoint advertises a max_idle_timeout, but the effective value
# at an endpoint is computed as the minimum of the two advertised
# values.  By announcing a max_idle_timeout, an endpoint commits to
# initiating an immediate close (Section 10.2) if it abandons the
# connection prior to the effective value.
# 
# An endpoint restarts its idle timer when a packet from its peer is
# received and processed successfully.  An endpoint also restarts its
# idle timer when sending an ack-eliciting packet if no other ack-
# 
# eliciting packets have been sent since last receiving and processing
# a packet.  Restarting this timer when sending a packet ensures that
# connections are not closed after new activity is initiated.
# 
# To avoid excessively small idle timeout periods, endpoints MUST
# increase the idle timeout period to be at least three times the
# current Probe Timeout (PTO).  This allows for multiple PTOs to
# expire, and therefore multiple probes to be sent and lost, prior to
# idle timeout.
