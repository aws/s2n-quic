# 21.3.  Optimistic ACK Attack
#
# An endpoint that acknowledges packets it has not received might cause
# a congestion controller to permit sending at rates beyond what the
# network supports.  An endpoint MAY skip packet numbers when sending
# packets to detect this behavior.  An endpoint can then immediately
# close the connection with a connection error of type
# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION; see Section 10.2.
