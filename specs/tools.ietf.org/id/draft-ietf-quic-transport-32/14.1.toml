# 14.1.  Initial Datagram Size
#
# A client MUST expand the payload of all UDP datagrams carrying
# Initial packets to at least the smallest allowed maximum datagram
# size of 1200 bytes by adding PADDING frames to the Initial packet or
# by coalescing the Initial packet; see Section 12.2.  Similarly, a
# server MUST expand the payload of all UDP datagrams carrying ack-
# eliciting Initial packets to at least the smallest allowed maximum
# datagram size of 1200 bytes.  Sending UDP datagrams of this size
# ensures that the network path supports a reasonable Path Maximum
# Transmission Unit (PMTU), in both directions.  Additionally, a client
# that expands Initial packets helps reduce the amplitude of
# amplification attacks caused by server responses toward an unverified
# client address; see Section 8.
# 
# Datagrams containing Initial packets MAY exceed 1200 bytes if the
# sender believes that the network path and peer both support the size
# that it chooses.
# 
# A server MUST discard an Initial packet that is carried in a UDP
# datagram with a payload that is smaller than the smallest allowed
# maximum datagram size of 1200 bytes.  A server MAY also immediately
# close the connection by sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with an
# error code of PROTOCOL_VIOLATION; see Section 10.2.3.
# 
# The server MUST also limit the number of bytes it sends before
# validating the address of the client; see Section 8.
