# 19.12.  DATA_BLOCKED Frames
#
# A sender SHOULD send a DATA_BLOCKED frame (type=0x14) when it wishes
# to send data, but is unable to do so due to connection-level flow
# control; see Section 4.  DATA_BLOCKED frames can be used as input to
# tuning of flow control algorithms; see Section 4.2.
# 
# DATA_BLOCKED frames are formatted as shown in Figure 36.
# 
# DATA_BLOCKED Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x14,
#   Maximum Data (i),
# }
# 
#                  Figure 36: DATA_BLOCKED Frame Format
# 
# DATA_BLOCKED frames contain the following field:
# 
# Maximum Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the connection-
#    level limit at which blocking occurred.
