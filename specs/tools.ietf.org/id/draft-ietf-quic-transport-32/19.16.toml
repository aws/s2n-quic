# 19.16.  RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frames
#
# An endpoint sends a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame (type=0x19) to
# indicate that it will no longer use a connection ID that was issued
# by its peer.  This may include the connection ID provided during the
# handshake.  Sending a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame also serves as a
# request to the peer to send additional connection IDs for future use;
# see Section 5.1.  New connection IDs can be delivered to a peer using
# the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (Section 19.15).
# 
# Retiring a connection ID invalidates the stateless reset token
# associated with that connection ID.
# 
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames are formatted as shown in Figure 40.
# 
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x19,
#   Sequence Number (i),
# }
# 
#              Figure 40: RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frame Format
# 
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames contain the following field:
# 
# Sequence Number:  The sequence number of the connection ID being
#    retired; see Section 5.1.2.
# 
# Receipt of a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame containing a sequence number
# greater than any previously sent to the peer MUST be treated as a
# connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# The sequence number specified in a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame MUST
# NOT refer to the Destination Connection ID field of the packet in
# which the frame is contained.  The peer MAY treat this as a
# connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# An endpoint cannot send this frame if it was provided with a zero-
# length connection ID by its peer.  An endpoint that provides a zero-
# length connection ID MUST treat receipt of a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID
# frame as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
