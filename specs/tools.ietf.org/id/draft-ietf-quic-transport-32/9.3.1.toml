# 9.3.1.  Peer Address Spoofing
#
# It is possible that a peer is spoofing its source address to cause an
# endpoint to send excessive amounts of data to an unwilling host.  If
# the endpoint sends significantly more data than the spoofing peer,
# connection migration might be used to amplify the volume of data that
# an attacker can generate toward a victim.
# 
# As described in Section 9.3, an endpoint is required to validate a
# peer's new address to confirm the peer's possession of the new
# address.  Until a peer's address is deemed valid, an endpoint MUST
# limit the rate at which it sends data to this address.  The endpoint
# MUST NOT send more than a minimum congestion window's worth of data
# per estimated round-trip time (kMinimumWindow, as defined in
# [QUIC-RECOVERY]).  In the absence of this limit, an endpoint risks
# being used for a denial of service attack against an unsuspecting
# victim.  Note that since the endpoint will not have any round-trip
# time measurements to this address, the estimate SHOULD be the default
# initial value; see [QUIC-RECOVERY].
# 
# If an endpoint skips validation of a peer address as described above,
# it does not need to limit its sending rate.
