# 14.3.  Datagram Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery
#
# Datagram Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD; [DPLPMTUD])
# relies on tracking loss or acknowledgment of QUIC packets that are
# carried in PMTU probes.  PMTU probes for DPLPMTUD that use the
# PADDING frame implement "Probing using padding data", as defined in
# Section 4.1 of [DPLPMTUD].
# 
# Endpoints SHOULD set the initial value of BASE_PLPMTU (Section 5.1 of
# [DPLPMTUD]) to be consistent with QUIC's smallest allowed maximum
# datagram size.  The MIN_PLPMTU is the same as the BASE_PLPMTU.
# 
# QUIC endpoints implementing DPLPMTUD maintain a DPLPMTUD Maximum
# Packet Size (MPS, Section 4.4 of [DPLPMTUD]) for each combination of
# local and remote IP addresses.  This corresponds to the maximum
# datagram size.
