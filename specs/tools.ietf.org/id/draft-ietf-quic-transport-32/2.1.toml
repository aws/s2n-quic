# 2.1.  Stream Types and Identifiers
#
# Streams can be unidirectional or bidirectional.  Unidirectional
# streams carry data in one direction: from the initiator of the stream
# to its peer.  Bidirectional streams allow for data to be sent in both
# directions.
# 
# Streams are identified within a connection by a numeric value,
# referred to as the stream ID.  A stream ID is a 62-bit integer (0 to
# 2^62-1) that is unique for all streams on a connection.  Stream IDs
# are encoded as variable-length integers; see Section 16.  A QUIC
# endpoint MUST NOT reuse a stream ID within a connection.
# 
# The least significant bit (0x1) of the stream ID identifies the
# initiator of the stream.  Client-initiated streams have even-numbered
# stream IDs (with the bit set to 0), and server-initiated streams have
# odd-numbered stream IDs (with the bit set to 1).
# 
# The second least significant bit (0x2) of the stream ID distinguishes
# between bidirectional streams (with the bit set to 0) and
# unidirectional streams (with the bit set to 1).
# 
# The two least significant bits from a stream ID therefore identify a
# stream as one of four types, as summarized in Table 1.
# 
#              +======+==================================+
#              | Bits | Stream Type                      |
#              +======+==================================+
#              | 0x0  | Client-Initiated, Bidirectional  |
#              +------+----------------------------------+
#              | 0x1  | Server-Initiated, Bidirectional  |
#              +------+----------------------------------+
#              | 0x2  | Client-Initiated, Unidirectional |
#              +------+----------------------------------+
#              | 0x3  | Server-Initiated, Unidirectional |
#              +------+----------------------------------+
# 
#                        Table 1: Stream ID Types
# 
# The stream space for each type begins at the minimum value (0x0
# through 0x3 respectively); successive streams of each type are
# created with numerically increasing stream IDs.  A stream ID that is
# used out of order results in all streams of that type with lower-
# numbered stream IDs also being opened.
