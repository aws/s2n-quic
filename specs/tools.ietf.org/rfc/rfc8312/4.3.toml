# 4.3.  Concave Region
#
# When receiving an ACK in congestion avoidance, if CUBIC is not in the
# TCP-friendly region and cwnd is less than W_max, then CUBIC is in the
# concave region.  In this region, cwnd MUST be incremented by
# (W_cubic(t+RTT) - cwnd)/cwnd for each received ACK, where
# W_cubic(t+RTT) is calculated using Eq. 1.
