# 5.8.  Behavior for Application-Limited Flows
#
# CUBIC does not raise its congestion window size if the flow is
# currently limited by the application instead of the congestion
# window.  In case of long periods when cwnd has not been updated due
# to the application rate limit, such as idle periods, t in Eq. 1 MUST
# NOT include these periods; otherwise, W_cubic(t) might be very high
# after restarting from these periods.
