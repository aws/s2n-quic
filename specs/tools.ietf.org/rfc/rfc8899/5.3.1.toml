# 5.3.1.  Probing for a Larger PLPMTU
#
# Implementations use a search algorithm across the search range to
# determine whether a larger PLPMTU can be supported across a network
# path.
# 
# The method discovers the search range by confirming the minimum
# PLPMTU and then using the probe method to select a PROBED_SIZE less
# than or equal to MAX_PLPMTU.  MAX_PLPMTU is the minimum of the local
# MTU and EMTU_R (when this is learned from the remote endpoint).  The
# MAX_PLPMTU MAY be reduced by an application that sets a maximum to
# the size of datagrams it will send.
# 
# The PROBE_COUNT is initialized to zero when the first probe with a
# size greater than or equal to PLPMTU is sent.  Each probe packet
# successfully sent to the remote peer is confirmed by acknowledgment
# at the PL (see Section 4.1).
# 
# Each time a probe packet is sent to the destination, the PROBE_TIMER
# is started.  The timer is canceled when the PL receives
# acknowledgment that the probe packet has been successfully sent
# across the path (Section 4.1).  This confirms that the PROBED_SIZE is
# supported, and the PROBED_SIZE value is then assigned to the PLPMTU.
# The search algorithm can continue to send subsequent probe packets of
# an increasing size.
# 
# If the timer expires before a probe packet is acknowledged, the probe
# has failed to confirm the PROBED_SIZE.  Each time the PROBE_TIMER
# expires, the PROBE_COUNT is incremented, the PROBE_TIMER is
# reinitialized, and a new probe of the same size or any other size
# (determined by the search algorithm) can be sent.  The maximum number
# of consecutive failed probes is configured (MAX_PROBES).  If the
# value of the PROBE_COUNT reaches MAX_PROBES, probing will stop, and
# the PL sender enters the SEARCH_COMPLETE state.
