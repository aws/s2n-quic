# 4.2.  Confirmation of Probed Packet Size
#
# The PL needs a method to determine (confirm) when probe packets have
# been successfully received end-to-end across a network path.
# 
# Transport protocols can include end-to-end methods that detect and
# report reception of specific datagrams that they send (e.g., DCCP,
# SCTP, and QUIC provide keep-alive/heartbeat features).  When
# supported, this mechanism MAY also be used by DPLPMTUD to acknowledge
# reception of a probe packet.
# 
# A PL that does not acknowledge data reception (e.g., UDP and UDP-
# Lite) is unable itself to detect when the packets that it sends are
# discarded because their size is greater than the actual PMTU.  These
# PLs need to rely on an application protocol to detect this loss.
# 
# Section 6 specifies this function for a set of IETF-specified
# protocols.
