# 6.1.  Application Support for DPLPMTUD with UDP or UDP-Lite
#
# The current specifications of UDP [RFC0768] and UDP-Lite [RFC3828] do
# not define a method in the RFC series that supports PLPMTUD.  In
# particular, the UDP transport does not provide the transport features
# needed to implement datagram PLPMTUD.
# 
# The DPLPMTUD method can be implemented as a part of an application
# built directly or indirectly on UDP or UDP-Lite but relies on higher-
# layer protocol features to implement the method [BCP145].
# 
# Some primitives used by DPLPMTUD might not be available via the
# Datagram API (e.g., the ability to access the PLPMTU from the IP-
# layer cache or to interpret received PTB messages).
# 
# In addition, it is recommended that PMTU discovery is not performed
# by multiple protocol layers.  An application SHOULD avoid using
# DPLPMTUD when the underlying transport system provides this
# capability.  A common method for managing the PLPMTU has benefits,
# both in the ability to share state between different processes and in
# opportunities to coordinate probing for different PL instances.
