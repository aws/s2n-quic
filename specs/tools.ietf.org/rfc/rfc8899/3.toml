# 3.  Features Required to Provide Datagram PLPMTUD
#
# The principles expressed in [RFC4821] apply to the use of the
# technique with any PL.  TCP PLPMTUD has been defined using standard
# TCP protocol mechanisms.  Unlike TCP, a datagram PL requires
# additional mechanisms and considerations to implement PLPMTUD.
# 
# The requirements for datagram PLPMTUD are:
# 
# 1.  Managing the PLPMTU: For datagram PLs, the PLPMTU is managed by
#     DPLPMTUD.  A PL MUST NOT send a datagram (other than a probe
#     packet) with a size at the PL that is larger than the current
#     PLPMTU.
# 
# 2.  Probe packets: The network interface below the PL is REQUIRED to
#     provide a way to transmit a probe packet that is larger than the
#     PLPMTU.  In IPv4, a probe packet MUST be sent with the Don't
#     Fragment (DF) bit set in the IP header and without network layer
#     endpoint fragmentation.  In IPv6, a probe packet is always sent
#     without source fragmentation (as specified in Section 5.4 of
#     [RFC8201]).
# 
# 3.  Reception feedback: The destination PL endpoint is REQUIRED to
#     provide a feedback method that indicates to the DPLPMTUD sender
#     when a probe packet has been received by the destination PL
#     endpoint.  Section 6 provides examples of how a PL can provide
#     this acknowledgment of received probe packets.
# 
# 4.  Probe loss recovery: It is RECOMMENDED to use probe packets that
#     do not carry any user data that would require retransmission if
#     lost.  Most datagram transports permit this.  If a probe packet
#     contains user data requiring retransmission in case of loss, the
#     PL (or layers above) is REQUIRED to arrange any retransmission
#     and/or repair of any resulting loss.  The PL is REQUIRED to be
#     robust in the case where probe packets are lost due to other
#     reasons (including link transmission error, congestion).
# 
# 5.  PMTU parameters: A DPLPMTUD sender is RECOMMENDED to utilize
#     information about the maximum size of packet that can be
#     transmitted by the sender on the local link (e.g., the local link
#     MTU).  A PL sender MAY utilize similar information about the
#     maximum size of network-layer packet that a receiver can accept
#     when this is supplied (note this could be less than EMTU_R).
#     This avoids implementations trying to send probe packets that
#     cannot be transferred by the local link.  Too high of a value
#     could reduce the efficiency of the search algorithm.  Some
#     applications also have a maximum transport protocol data unit
#     (PDU) size, in which case there is no benefit from probing for a
#     size larger than this (unless a transport allows multiplexing
#     multiple applications' PDUs into the same datagram).
# 
# 6.  Processing PTB messages: A DPLPMTUD sender MAY optionally utilize
#     PTB messages received from the network layer to help identify
#     when a network path does not support the current size of probe
#     packet.  Any received PTB message MUST be validated before it is
#     used to update the PLPMTU discovery information [RFC8201].  This
#     validation confirms that the PTB message was sent in response to
#     a packet originated by the sender and needs to be performed
#     before the PLPMTU discovery method reacts to the PTB message.  A
#     PTB message MUST NOT be used to increase the PLPMTU [RFC8201] but
#     could trigger a probe to test for a larger PLPMTU.  A valid
#     PTB_SIZE is converted to a PL_PTB_SIZE before it is to be used in
#     the DPLPMTUD state machine.  A PL_PTB_SIZE that is greater than
#     that currently probed SHOULD be ignored.  (This PTB message ought
#     to be discarded without further processing but could be utilized
#     as an input that enables a resilience mode).
# 
# 7.  Probing and congestion control: A PL MAY use a congestion
#     controller to decide when to send a probe packet.  If
#     transmission of probe packets is limited by the congestion
#     controller, this could result in transmission of probe packets
#     being delayed or suspended during congestion.  When the
#     transmission of probe packets is not controlled by the congestion
#     controller, the interval between probe packets MUST be at least
#     one RTT.  Loss of a probe packet SHOULD NOT be treated as an
#     indication of congestion and SHOULD NOT trigger a congestion
#     control reaction [RFC4821] because this could result in
#     unnecessary reduction of the sending rate.  An update to the
#     PLPMTU (or MPS) MUST NOT increase the congestion window measured
#     in bytes [RFC4821].  Therefore, an increase in the packet size
#     does not cause an increase in the data rate in bytes per second.
#     A PL that maintains the congestion window in terms of a limit to
#     the number of outstanding fixed-size packets SHOULD adapt this
#     limit to compensate for the size of the actual packets.  The
#     transmission of probe packets can interact with the operation of
#     a PL that performs burst mitigation or pacing, and the PL could
#     need transmission of probe packets to be regulated by these
#     methods.
# 
# 8.  Probing and flow control: Flow control at the PL concerns the
#     end-to-end flow of data using the PL service.  Flow control
#     SHOULD NOT apply to DPLPMTU when probe packets use a design that
#     does not carry user data to the remote application.
# 
# 9.  Shared PLPMTU state: The PMTU value calculated from the PLPMTU
#     MAY also be stored with the corresponding entry associated with
#     the destination in the IP layer cache and used by other PL
#     instances.  The specification of PLPMTUD [RFC4821] states, "If
#     PLPMTUD updates the MTU for a particular path, all Packetization
#     Layer sessions that share the path representation (as described
#     in Section 5.2) SHOULD be notified to make use of the new MTU".
#     Such methods MUST be robust to the wide variety of underlying
#     network forwarding behaviors.  Section 5.2 of [RFC8201] provides
#     guidance on the caching of PMTU information and also the relation
#     to IPv6 flow labels.
# 
# In addition, the following principles are stated for design of a
# DPLPMTUD method:
# 
# *  A PL MAY be designed to segment data blocks larger than the MPS
#    into multiple datagrams.  However, not all datagram PLs support
#    segmentation of data blocks.  It is RECOMMENDED that methods avoid
#    forcing an application to use an arbitrary small MPS for
#    transmission while the method is searching for the currently
#    supported PLPMTU.  A reduced MPS can adversely impact the
#    performance of an application.
# 
# *  To assist applications in choosing a suitable data block size, the
#    PL is RECOMMENDED to provide a primitive that returns the MPS
#    derived from the PLPMTU to the higher layer using the PL.  The
#    value of the MPS can change following a change in the path or loss
#    of probe packets.
# 
# *  Path validation: It is RECOMMENDED that methods are robust to path
#    changes that could have occurred since the path characteristics
#    were last confirmed and to the possibility of inconsistent path
#    information being received.
# 
# *  Datagram reordering: A method is REQUIRED to be robust to the
#    possibility that a flow encounters reordering or that the traffic
#    (including probe packets) is divided over more than one network
#    path.
# 
# *  Datagram delay and duplication: The feedback mechanism is REQUIRED
#    to be robust to the possibility that packets could be
#    significantly delayed or duplicated along a network path.
# 
# *  When to probe: It is RECOMMENDED that methods determine whether
#    the path has changed since it last measured the path.  This can
#    help determine when to probe the path again.
