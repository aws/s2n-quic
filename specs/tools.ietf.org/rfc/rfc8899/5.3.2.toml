# 5.3.2.  Selection of Probe Sizes
#
# The search algorithm determines a minimum useful gain in PLPMTU.  It
# would not be constructive for a PL sender to attempt to probe for all
# sizes.  This would incur unnecessary load on the path.
# Implementations SHOULD select the set of probe packet sizes to
# maximize the gain in PLPMTU from each search step.
# 
# Implementations could optimize the search procedure by selecting step
# sizes from a table of common PMTU sizes.  When selecting the
# appropriate next size to search, an implementer ought to also
# consider that there can be common sizes of MPS that applications seek
# to use, and there could be common sizes of MTU used within the
# network.
