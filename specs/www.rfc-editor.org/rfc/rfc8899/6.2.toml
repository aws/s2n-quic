# 6.2.  DPLPMTUD for SCTP
#
# Section 10.2 of [RFC4821] specifies a recommended PLPMTUD probing
# method for SCTP, and Section 7.3 of [RFC4960] recommends an endpoint
# apply the techniques in RFC 4821 on a per-destination-address basis.
# The specification for DPLPMTUD continues the practice of using the PL
# to discover the PMTU but updates RFC4960 with a recommendation to use
# the method specified in this document: The RECOMMENDED method for
# generating probes is to add a chunk consisting only of padding to an
# SCTP message.  The PAD chunk defined in [RFC4820] SHOULD be attached
# to a minimum-length HEARTBEAT (HB) chunk to build a probe packet.
# This enables probing without affecting the transfer of user messages
# and without being limited by congestion control or flow control.
# This is preferred to using DATA chunks (with padding as required) as
# path probes.
# 
# Section 6.9 of [RFC4960] describes dividing the user messages into
# DATA chunks sent by the PL when using SCTP.  This notes that once an
# SCTP message has been sent, it cannot be resegmented.  [RFC4960]
# describes the method for retransmitting DATA chunks when the MPS has
# been reduced, and Section 6.9 of [RFC4960] describes use of IP
# fragmentation for this case.  This is unchanged by this document.
