# 6.1.1.  Application Request
#
# An application needs an application-layer protocol mechanism (such as
# a message acknowledgment method) that solicits a response from a
# destination endpoint.  The method SHOULD allow the sender to check
# the value returned in the response to provide additional protection
# from off-path insertion of data [BCP145].  Suitable methods include a
# parameter known only to the two endpoints, such as a session ID or
# initialized sequence number.
