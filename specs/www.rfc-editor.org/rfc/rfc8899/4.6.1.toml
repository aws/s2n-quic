# 4.6.1.  Validation of PTB Messages
#
# This section specifies utilization and validation of PTB messages.
# 
# *  A simple implementation MAY ignore received PTB messages, and in
#    this case, the PLPMTU is not updated when a PTB message is
#    received.
# 
# *  A PL that supports PTB messages MUST validate these messages
#    before they are further processed.
# 
# A PL that receives a PTB message from a router or middlebox performs
# ICMP validation (see Section 4 of [RFC8201] and Section 5.2 of
# [BCP145]).  Because DPLPMTUD operates at the PL, the PL needs to
# check that each received PTB message is received in response to a
# packet transmitted by the endpoint PL performing DPLPMTUD.
# 
# The PL MUST check the protocol information in the quoted packet
# carried in an ICMP PTB message payload to validate the message
# originated from the sending node.  This validation includes
# determining that the combination of the IP addresses, the protocol,
# the source port, and destination port match those returned in the
# quoted packet -- this is also necessary for the PTB message to be
# passed to the corresponding PL.
# 
# The validation SHOULD utilize information that is not simple for an
# off-path attacker to determine [BCP145].  For example, it could check
# the value of a protocol header field known only to the two PL
# endpoints.  A datagram application that uses well-known source and
# destination ports ought to also rely on other information to complete
# this validation.
# 
# These checks are intended to provide protection from packets that
# originate from a node that is not on the network path.  A PTB message
# that does not complete the validation MUST NOT be further utilized by
# the DPLPMTUD method, as discussed in the Security Considerations
# section (Section 8).
# 
# Section 4.6.2 describes this processing of PTB messages.
