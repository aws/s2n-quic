# 6.2.1.4.  PTB Message Handling by SCTP
#
# Normal ICMP validation MUST be performed as specified in Appendix C
# of [RFC4960].  This requires that the first 8 bytes of the SCTP
# common header are quoted in the payload of the PTB message, which can
# be the case for ICMPv4 and is normally the case for ICMPv6.
# 
# When a PTB message has been validated, the PL_PTB_SIZE calculated
# from the PTB_SIZE reported in the PTB message SHOULD be used with the
# DPLPMTUD algorithm, provided that the reported PL_PTB_SIZE is less
# than the current probe size (see Section 4.6).
