# 5.  Datagram Packetization Layer PMTUD
#
# This section specifies Datagram PLPMTUD (DPLPMTUD).  The method can
# be introduced at various points (as indicated with * in Figure 2) in
# the IP protocol stack to discover the PLPMTU so that an application
# can utilize an appropriate MPS for the current network path.
# 
# DPLPMTUD SHOULD only be performed at one layer between a pair of
# endpoints.  Therefore, an upper PL or application should avoid using
# DPLPMTUD when this is already enabled in a lower layer.  A PL MUST
# adjust the MPS indicated by DPLPMTUD to account for any additional
# overhead introduced by the PL.

#          Figure 2: Examples Where DPLPMTUD Can Be Implemented
# 
# The central idea of DPLPMTUD is probing by a sender.  Probe packets
# are sent to find the maximum size of user message that can be
# completely transferred across the network path from the sender to the
# destination.
# 
# The following sections identify the components needed for
# implementation, provide an overview of the phases of operation, and
# specify the state machine and search algorithm.
