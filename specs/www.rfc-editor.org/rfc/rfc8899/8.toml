# 8.  Security Considerations
#
# The security considerations for the use of UDP and SCTP are provided
# in the referenced RFCs.
# 
# To avoid excessive load, the interval between individual probe
# packets MUST be at least one RTT, and the interval between rounds of
# probing is determined by the PMTU_RAISE_TIMER.
# 
# A PL sender needs to ensure that the method used to confirm reception
# of probe packets protects from off-path attackers injecting packets
# into the path.  This protection is provided in IETF-defined protocols
# (e.g., TCP, SCTP) using a randomly initialized sequence number.  A
# description of one way to do this when using UDP is provided in
# Section 5.1 of [BCP145]).
# 
# There are cases where ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages are not
# delivered due to policy, configuration, or equipment design (see
# Section 1.1).  This method therefore does not rely upon PTB messages
# being received but is able to utilize these when they are received by
# the sender.  PTB messages could potentially be used to cause a node
# to inappropriately reduce the PLPMTU.  A node supporting DPLPMTUD
# MUST therefore appropriately validate the payload of PTB messages to
# ensure these are received in response to transmitted traffic (i.e., a
# reported error condition that corresponds to a datagram actually sent
# by the path layer, see Section 4.6.1).
# 
# An on-path attacker able to create a PTB message could forge PTB
# messages that include a valid quoted IP packet.  Such an attack could
# be used to drive down the PLPMTU.  An on-path device could similarly
# force a reduction of the PLPMTU by implementing a policy that drops
# packets larger than a configured size.  There are two ways this
# method can be mitigated against such attacks: first, by ensuring that
# a PL sender never reduces the PLPMTU below the base size solely in
# response to receiving a PTB message.  This is achieved by first
# entering the BASE state when such a message is received.  Second, the
# design does not require processing of PTB messages; a PL sender could
# therefore suspend processing of PTB messages (e.g., in a robustness
# mode after detecting that subsequent probes actually confirm that a
# size larger than the PTB_SIZE is supported by a path).
# 
# Parsing the quoted packet inside a PTB message can introduce
# additional per-packet processing at the PL sender.  This processing
# SHOULD be limited to avoid a denial-of-service attack when arbitrary
# headers are included.  Rate-limiting the processing could result in
# PTB messages not being received by a PL; however, the DPLPMTUD method
# is robust to such loss.
# 
# The successful processing of an ICMP message can trigger a probe when
# the reported PTB size is valid, but this does not directly update the
# PLPMTU for the path.  This prevents a message attempting to black
# hole data by indicating a size larger than supported by the path.
# 
# It is possible that the information about a path is not stable.  This
# could be a result of forwarding across more than one path that has a
# different actual PMTU or a single path presents a varying PMTU.  The
# design of a PLPMTUD implementation SHOULD consider how to mitigate
# the effects of varying path information.  One possible mitigation is
# to provide robustness (see Section 5.4) in the method that avoids
# oscillation in the MPS.
# 
# DPLPMTUD methods can introduce padding data to inflate the length of
# the datagram to the total size required for a probe packet.  The
# total size of a probe packet includes all headers and padding added
# to the payload data being sent (e.g., including security-related
# fields such as an AEAD tag and TLS record layer padding).  The value
# of the padding data does not influence the DPLPMTUD search algorithm,
# and therefore needs to be set consistent with the policy of the PL.
# 
# If a PL can make use of cryptographic confidentiality or data-
# integrity mechanisms, then the design ought to avoid adding anything
# (e.g., padding) to DPLPMTUD probe packets that is not also protected
# by those cryptographic mechanisms.
