# 4.4.  The Maximum Packet Size (MPS)
#
# The result of probing determines a usable PLPMTU, which is used to
# set the MPS used by the application.  The MPS is smaller than the
# PLPMTU because it is reduced by the size of PL headers (including the
# overhead of security-related fields such as an AEAD tag and TLS
# record layer padding).  The relationship between the MPS and the
# PLPMTUD is illustrated in Figure 1.
# 
# Any additional
#   headers         .--- MPS -----.

#             Figure 1: Relationship between MPS and PLPMTU
# 
# A PL is unable to send a packet (other than a probe packet) with a
# size larger than the current PLPMTU at the network layer.  To avoid
# this, a PL MAY be designed to segment data blocks larger than the MPS
# into multiple datagrams.
# 
# DPLPMTUD seeks to avoid IP fragmentation.  An attempt to send a data
# block larger than the MPS will therefore fail if a PL is unable to
# segment data.  To determine the largest data block that can be sent,
# a PL SHOULD provide applications with a primitive that returns the
# MPS, derived from the current PLPMTU.
# 
# If DPLPMTUD results in a change to the MPS, the application needs to
# adapt to the new MPS.  A particular case can arise when packets have
# been sent with a size less than the MPS and the PLPMTU was
# subsequently reduced.  If these packets are lost, the PL MAY segment
# the data using the new MPS.  If a PL is unable to resegment a
# previously sent datagram (e.g., [RFC4960]), then the sender either
# discards the datagram or could perform retransmission using network-
# layer fragmentation to form multiple IP packets not larger than the
# PLPMTU.  For IPv4, the use of endpoint fragmentation by the sender is
# preferred over clearing the DF bit in the IPv4 header.  Operational
# experience reveals that IP fragmentation can reduce the reliability
# of Internet communication [RFC8900], which may reduce the probability
# of successful retransmission.
