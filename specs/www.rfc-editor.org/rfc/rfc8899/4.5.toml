# 4.5.  Disabling the Effect of PMTUD
#
# A PL implementing this specification MUST suspend network layer
# processing of outgoing packets that enforces a PMTU
# [RFC1191][RFC8201] for each flow utilizing DPLPMTUD and instead use
# DPLPMTUD to control the size of packets that are sent by a flow.
# This removes the need for the network layer to drop or to fragment
# sent packets that have a size greater than the PMTU.
