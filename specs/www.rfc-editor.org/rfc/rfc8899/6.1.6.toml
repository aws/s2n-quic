# 6.1.6.  Handling of PTB Messages
#
# An application that is able and wishes to receive PTB messages MUST
# perform ICMP validation as specified in Section 5.2 of [BCP145].
# This requires that the application checks each received PTB message
# to validate that it was is received in response to transmitted
# traffic and that the reported PL_PTB_SIZE is less than the current
# probed size (see Section 4.6.2).  A validated PTB message MAY be used
# as input to the DPLPMTUD algorithm but MUST NOT be used directly to
# set the PLPMTU.
