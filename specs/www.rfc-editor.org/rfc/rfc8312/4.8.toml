# 4.8.  Slow Start
#
# CUBIC MUST employ a slow-start algorithm, when the cwnd is no more
# than ssthresh.  Among the slow-start algorithms, CUBIC MAY choose the
# standard TCP slow start [RFC5681] in general networks, or the limited
# slow start [RFC3742] or hybrid slow start [HR08] for fast and long-
# distance networks.
# 
# In the case when CUBIC runs the hybrid slow start [HR08], it may exit
# the first slow start without incurring any packet loss and thus W_max
# is undefined.  In this special case, CUBIC switches to congestion
# avoidance and increases its congestion window size using Eq. 1, where
# t is the elapsed time since the beginning of the current congestion
# avoidance, K is set to 0, and W_max is set to the congestion window
# size at the beginning of the current congestion avoidance.
