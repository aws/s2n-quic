# 4.5.  Multiplicative Decrease
#
# When a packet loss is detected by duplicate ACKs or a network
# congestion is detected by ECN-Echo ACKs, CUBIC updates its W_max,
# cwnd, and ssthresh as follows.  Parameter beta_cubic SHOULD be set to
# 0.7.
# 
#    W_max = cwnd;                 // save window size before reduction
#    ssthresh = cwnd * beta_cubic; // new slow-start threshold
#    ssthresh = max(ssthresh, 2);  // threshold is at least 2 MSS
#    cwnd = cwnd * beta_cubic;     // window reduction
# 
# A side effect of setting beta_cubic to a value bigger than 0.5 is
# slower convergence.  We believe that while a more adaptive setting of
# beta_cubic could result in faster convergence, it will make the
# analysis of CUBIC much harder.  This adaptive adjustment of
# beta_cubic is an item for the next version of CUBIC.
