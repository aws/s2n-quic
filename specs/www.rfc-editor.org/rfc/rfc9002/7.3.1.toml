# 7.3.1.  Slow Start
#
# A NewReno sender is in slow start any time the congestion window is
# below the slow start threshold.  A sender begins in slow start
# because the slow start threshold is initialized to an infinite value.
# 
# While a sender is in slow start, the congestion window increases by
# the number of bytes acknowledged when each acknowledgment is
# processed.  This results in exponential growth of the congestion
# window.
# 
# The sender MUST exit slow start and enter a recovery period when a
# packet is lost or when the ECN-CE count reported by its peer
# increases.
# 
# A sender reenters slow start any time the congestion window is less
# than the slow start threshold, which only occurs after persistent
# congestion is declared.
