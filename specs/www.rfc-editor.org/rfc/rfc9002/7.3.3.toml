# 7.3.3.  Congestion Avoidance
#
# A NewReno sender is in congestion avoidance any time the congestion
# window is at or above the slow start threshold and not in a recovery
# period.
# 
# A sender in congestion avoidance uses an Additive Increase
# Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) approach that MUST limit the increase
# to the congestion window to at most one maximum datagram size for
# each congestion window that is acknowledged.
# 
# The sender exits congestion avoidance and enters a recovery period
# when a packet is lost or when the ECN-CE count reported by its peer
# increases.
