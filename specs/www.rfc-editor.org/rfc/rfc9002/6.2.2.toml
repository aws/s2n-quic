# 6.2.2.  Handshakes and New Paths
#
# Resumed connections over the same network MAY use the previous
# connection's final smoothed RTT value as the resumed connection's
# initial RTT.  When no previous RTT is available, the initial RTT
# SHOULD be set to 333 milliseconds.  This results in handshakes
# starting with a PTO of 1 second, as recommended for TCP's initial
# RTO; see Section 2 of [RFC6298].
# 
# A connection MAY use the delay between sending a PATH_CHALLENGE and
# receiving a PATH_RESPONSE to set the initial RTT (see kInitialRtt in
# Appendix A.2) for a new path, but the delay SHOULD NOT be considered
# an RTT sample.
# 
# When the Initial keys and Handshake keys are discarded (see
# Section 6.4), any Initial packets and Handshake packets can no longer
# be acknowledged, so they are removed from bytes in flight.  When
# Initial or Handshake keys are discarded, the PTO and loss detection
# timers MUST be reset, because discarding keys indicates forward
# progress and the loss detection timer might have been set for a now-
# discarded packet number space.
