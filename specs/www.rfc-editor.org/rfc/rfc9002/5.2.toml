# 5.2.  Estimating min_rtt
#
# min_rtt is the sender's estimate of the minimum RTT observed for a
# given network path over a period of time.  In this document, min_rtt
# is used by loss detection to reject implausibly small RTT samples.
# 
# min_rtt MUST be set to the latest_rtt on the first RTT sample.
# min_rtt MUST be set to the lesser of min_rtt and latest_rtt
# (Section 5.1) on all other samples.
# 
# An endpoint uses only locally observed times in computing the min_rtt
# and does not adjust for acknowledgment delays reported by the peer.
# Doing so allows the endpoint to set a lower bound for the
# smoothed_rtt based entirely on what it observes (see Section 5.3) and
# limits potential underestimation due to erroneously reported delays
# by the peer.
# 
# The RTT for a network path may change over time.  If a path's actual
# RTT decreases, the min_rtt will adapt immediately on the first low
# sample.  If the path's actual RTT increases, however, the min_rtt
# will not adapt to it, allowing future RTT samples that are smaller
# than the new RTT to be included in smoothed_rtt.
# 
# Endpoints SHOULD set the min_rtt to the newest RTT sample after
# persistent congestion is established.  This avoids repeatedly
# declaring persistent congestion when the RTT increases.  This also
# allows a connection to reset its estimate of min_rtt and smoothed_rtt
# after a disruptive network event; see Section 5.3.
# 
# Endpoints MAY reestablish the min_rtt at other times in the
# connection, such as when traffic volume is low and an acknowledgment
# is received with a low acknowledgment delay.  Implementations SHOULD
# NOT refresh the min_rtt value too often since the actual minimum RTT
# of the path is not frequently observable.
