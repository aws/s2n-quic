# 7.8.  Underutilizing the Congestion Window
#
# When bytes in flight is smaller than the congestion window and
# sending is not pacing limited, the congestion window is
# underutilized.  This can happen due to insufficient application data
# or flow control limits.  When this occurs, the congestion window
# SHOULD NOT be increased in either slow start or congestion avoidance.
# 
# A sender that paces packets (see Section 7.7) might delay sending
# packets and not fully utilize the congestion window due to this
# delay.  A sender SHOULD NOT consider itself application limited if it
# would have fully utilized the congestion window without pacing delay.
# 
# A sender MAY implement alternative mechanisms to update its
# congestion window after periods of underutilization, such as those
# proposed for TCP in [RFC7661].
