# 6.1.1.  Packet Threshold
#
# The RECOMMENDED initial value for the packet reordering threshold
# (kPacketThreshold) is 3, based on best practices for TCP loss
# detection [RFC5681] [RFC6675].  In order to remain similar to TCP,
# implementations SHOULD NOT use a packet threshold less than 3; see
# [RFC5681].
# 
# Some networks may exhibit higher degrees of packet reordering,
# causing a sender to detect spurious losses.  Additionally, packet
# reordering could be more common with QUIC than TCP because network
# elements that could observe and reorder TCP packets cannot do that
# for QUIC and also because QUIC packet numbers are encrypted.
# Algorithms that increase the reordering threshold after spuriously
# detecting losses, such as RACK [RFC8985], have proven to be useful in
# TCP and are expected to be at least as useful in QUIC.
