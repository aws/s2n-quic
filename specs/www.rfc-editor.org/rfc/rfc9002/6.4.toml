# 6.4.  Discarding Keys and Packet State
#
# When Initial and Handshake packet protection keys are discarded (see
# Section 4.9 of [QUIC-TLS]), all packets that were sent with those
# keys can no longer be acknowledged because their acknowledgments
# cannot be processed.  The sender MUST discard all recovery state
# associated with those packets and MUST remove them from the count of
# bytes in flight.
# 
# Endpoints stop sending and receiving Initial packets once they start
# exchanging Handshake packets; see Section 17.2.2.1 of
# [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  At this point, recovery state for all in-flight
# Initial packets is discarded.
# 
# When 0-RTT is rejected, recovery state for all in-flight 0-RTT
# packets is discarded.
# 
# If a server accepts 0-RTT, but does not buffer 0-RTT packets that
# arrive before Initial packets, early 0-RTT packets will be declared
# lost, but that is expected to be infrequent.
# 
# It is expected that keys are discarded at some time after the packets
# encrypted with them are either acknowledged or declared lost.
# However, Initial and Handshake secrets are discarded as soon as
# Handshake and 1-RTT keys are proven to be available to both client
# and server; see Section 4.9.1 of [QUIC-TLS].
