# 6.2.2.1.  Before Address Validation
#
# Until the server has validated the client's address on the path, the
# amount of data it can send is limited to three times the amount of
# data received, as specified in Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  If
# no additional data can be sent, the server's PTO timer MUST NOT be
# armed until datagrams have been received from the client because
# packets sent on PTO count against the anti-amplification limit.
# 
# When the server receives a datagram from the client, the
# amplification limit is increased and the server resets the PTO timer.
# If the PTO timer is then set to a time in the past, it is executed
# immediately.  Doing so avoids sending new 1-RTT packets prior to
# packets critical to the completion of the handshake.  In particular,
# this can happen when 0-RTT is accepted but the server fails to
# validate the client's address.
# 
# Since the server could be blocked until more datagrams are received
# from the client, it is the client's responsibility to send packets to
# unblock the server until it is certain that the server has finished
# its address validation (see Section 8 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  That is,
# the client MUST set the PTO timer if the client has not received an
# acknowledgment for any of its Handshake packets and the handshake is
# not confirmed (see Section 4.1.2 of [QUIC-TLS]), even if there are no
# packets in flight.  When the PTO fires, the client MUST send a
# Handshake packet if it has Handshake keys, otherwise it MUST send an
# Initial packet in a UDP datagram with a payload of at least 1200
# bytes.
