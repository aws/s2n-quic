# Probe packets MUST NOT be blocked by the congestion controller.  A
# sender MUST however count these packets as being additionally in
# flight, since these packets add network load without establishing
# packet loss.  Note that sending probe packets might cause the
# sender's bytes in flight to exceed the congestion window until an
# acknowledgment is received that establishes loss or delivery of
# packets.
