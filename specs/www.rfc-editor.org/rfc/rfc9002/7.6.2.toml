# 7.6.2.  Establishing Persistent Congestion
#
# A sender establishes persistent congestion after the receipt of an
# acknowledgment if two packets that are ack-eliciting are declared
# lost, and:
# 
# *  across all packet number spaces, none of the packets sent between
#    the send times of these two packets are acknowledged;
# 
# *  the duration between the send times of these two packets exceeds
#    the persistent congestion duration (Section 7.6.1); and
# 
# *  a prior RTT sample existed when these two packets were sent.
# 
# These two packets MUST be ack-eliciting, since a receiver is required
# to acknowledge only ack-eliciting packets within its maximum
# acknowledgment delay; see Section 13.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
# 
# The persistent congestion period SHOULD NOT start until there is at
# least one RTT sample.  Before the first RTT sample, a sender arms its
# PTO timer based on the initial RTT (Section 6.2.2), which could be
# substantially larger than the actual RTT.  Requiring a prior RTT
# sample prevents a sender from establishing persistent congestion with
# potentially too few probes.
# 
# Since network congestion is not affected by packet number spaces,
# persistent congestion SHOULD consider packets sent across packet
# number spaces.  A sender that does not have state for all packet
# number spaces or an implementation that cannot compare send times
# across packet number spaces MAY use state for just the packet number
# space that was acknowledged.  This might result in erroneously
# declaring persistent congestion, but it will not lead to a failure to
# detect persistent congestion.
# 
# When persistent congestion is declared, the sender's congestion
# window MUST be reduced to the minimum congestion window
# (kMinimumWindow), similar to a TCP sender's response on an RTO
# [RFC5681].
