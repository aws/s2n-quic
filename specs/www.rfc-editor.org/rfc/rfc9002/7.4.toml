# 7.4.  Ignoring Loss of Undecryptable Packets
#
# During the handshake, some packet protection keys might not be
# available when a packet arrives, and the receiver can choose to drop
# the packet.  In particular, Handshake and 0-RTT packets cannot be
# processed until the Initial packets arrive, and 1-RTT packets cannot
# be processed until the handshake completes.  Endpoints MAY ignore the
# loss of Handshake, 0-RTT, and 1-RTT packets that might have arrived
# before the peer had packet protection keys to process those packets.
# Endpoints MUST NOT ignore the loss of packets that were sent after
# the earliest acknowledged packet in a given packet number space.
