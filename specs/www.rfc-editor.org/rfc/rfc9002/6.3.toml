# 6.3.  Handling Retry Packets
#
# A Retry packet causes a client to send another Initial packet,
# effectively restarting the connection process.  A Retry packet
# indicates that the Initial packet was received but not processed.  A
# Retry packet cannot be treated as an acknowledgment because it does
# not indicate that a packet was processed or specify the packet
# number.
# 
# Clients that receive a Retry packet reset congestion control and loss
# recovery state, including resetting any pending timers.  Other
# connection state, in particular cryptographic handshake messages, is
# retained; see Section 17.2.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
# 
# The client MAY compute an RTT estimate to the server as the time
# period from when the first Initial packet was sent to when a Retry or
# a Version Negotiation packet is received.  The client MAY use this
# value in place of its default for the initial RTT estimate.
