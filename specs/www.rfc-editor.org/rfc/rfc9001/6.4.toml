# 6.4.  Sending with Updated Keys
#
# An endpoint never sends packets that are protected with old keys.
# Only the current keys are used.  Keys used for protecting packets can
# be discarded immediately after switching to newer keys.
# 
# Packets with higher packet numbers MUST be protected with either the
# same or newer packet protection keys than packets with lower packet
# numbers.  An endpoint that successfully removes protection with old
# keys when newer keys were used for packets with lower packet numbers
# MUST treat this as a connection error of type KEY_UPDATE_ERROR.
