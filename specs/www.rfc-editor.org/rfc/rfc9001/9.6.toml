# 9.6.  Key Diversity
#
# In using TLS, the central key schedule of TLS is used.  As a result
# of the TLS handshake messages being integrated into the calculation
# of secrets, the inclusion of the QUIC transport parameters extension
# ensures that the handshake and 1-RTT keys are not the same as those
# that might be produced by a server running TLS over TCP.  To avoid
# the possibility of cross-protocol key synchronization, additional
# measures are provided to improve key separation.
# 
# The QUIC packet protection keys and IVs are derived using a different
# label than the equivalent keys in TLS.
# 
# To preserve this separation, a new version of QUIC SHOULD define new
# labels for key derivation for packet protection key and IV, plus the
# header protection keys.  This version of QUIC uses the string "quic".
# Other versions can use a version-specific label in place of that
# string.
# 
# The initial secrets use a key that is specific to the negotiated QUIC
# version.  New QUIC versions SHOULD define a new salt value used in
# calculating initial secrets.
