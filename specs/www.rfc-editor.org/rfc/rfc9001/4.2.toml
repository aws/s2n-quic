# 4.2.  TLS Version
#
# This document describes how TLS 1.3 [TLS13] is used with QUIC.
# 
# In practice, the TLS handshake will negotiate a version of TLS to
# use.  This could result in a version of TLS newer than 1.3 being
# negotiated if both endpoints support that version.  This is
# acceptable provided that the features of TLS 1.3 that are used by
# QUIC are supported by the newer version.
# 
# Clients MUST NOT offer TLS versions older than 1.3.  A badly
# configured TLS implementation could negotiate TLS 1.2 or another
# older version of TLS.  An endpoint MUST terminate the connection if a
# version of TLS older than 1.3 is negotiated.
