# 4.4.  Peer Authentication
#
# The requirements for authentication depend on the application
# protocol that is in use.  TLS provides server authentication and
# permits the server to request client authentication.
# 
# A client MUST authenticate the identity of the server.  This
# typically involves verification that the identity of the server is
# included in a certificate and that the certificate is issued by a
# trusted entity (see for example [RFC2818]).
# 
#    |  Note: Where servers provide certificates for authentication,
#    |  the size of the certificate chain can consume a large number of
#    |  bytes.  Controlling the size of certificate chains is critical
#    |  to performance in QUIC as servers are limited to sending 3
#    |  bytes for every byte received prior to validating the client
#    |  address; see Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The size of a
#    |  certificate chain can be managed by limiting the number of
#    |  names or extensions; using keys with small public key
#    |  representations, like ECDSA; or by using certificate
#    |  compression [COMPRESS].
# 
# A server MAY request that the client authenticate during the
# handshake.  A server MAY refuse a connection if the client is unable
# to authenticate when requested.  The requirements for client
# authentication vary based on application protocol and deployment.
# 
# A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (as
# defined in Section 4.6.2 of [TLS13]) because the multiplexing offered
# by QUIC prevents clients from correlating the certificate request
# with the application-level event that triggered it (see
# [HTTP2-TLS13]).  More specifically, servers MUST NOT send post-
# handshake TLS CertificateRequest messages, and clients MUST treat
# receipt of such messages as a connection error of type
# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
