# 6.5.  Receiving with Different Keys
#
# For receiving packets during a key update, packets protected with
# older keys might arrive if they were delayed by the network.
# Retaining old packet protection keys allows these packets to be
# successfully processed.
# 
# As packets protected with keys from the next key phase use the same
# Key Phase value as those protected with keys from the previous key
# phase, it is necessary to distinguish between the two if packets
# protected with old keys are to be processed.  This can be done using
# packet numbers.  A recovered packet number that is lower than any
# packet number from the current key phase uses the previous packet
# protection keys; a recovered packet number that is higher than any
# packet number from the current key phase requires the use of the next
# packet protection keys.
# 
# Some care is necessary to ensure that any process for selecting
# between previous, current, and next packet protection keys does not
# expose a timing side channel that might reveal which keys were used
# to remove packet protection.  See Section 9.5 for more information.
# 
# Alternatively, endpoints can retain only two sets of packet
# protection keys, swapping previous for next after enough time has
# passed to allow for reordering in the network.  In this case, the Key
# Phase bit alone can be used to select keys.
# 
# An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout
# (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after promoting the next set of receive
# keys to be current before it creates the subsequent set of packet
# protection keys.  These updated keys MAY replace the previous keys at
# that time.  With the caveat that PTO is a subjective measure -- that
# is, a peer could have a different view of the RTT -- this time is
# expected to be long enough that any reordered packets would be
# declared lost by a peer even if they were acknowledged and short
# enough to allow a peer to initiate further key updates.
# 
# Endpoints need to allow for the possibility that a peer might not be
# able to decrypt packets that initiate a key update during the period
# when the peer retains old keys.  Endpoints SHOULD wait three times
# the PTO before initiating a key update after receiving an
# acknowledgment that confirms that the previous key update was
# received.  Failing to allow sufficient time could lead to packets
# being discarded.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD retain old read keys for no more than three times
# the PTO after having received a packet protected using the new keys.
# After this period, old read keys and their corresponding secrets
# SHOULD be discarded.
