# 4.1.2.  Handshake Confirmed
#
# In this document, the TLS handshake is considered confirmed at the
# server when the handshake completes.  The server MUST send a
# HANDSHAKE_DONE frame as soon as the handshake is complete.  At the
# client, the handshake is considered confirmed when a HANDSHAKE_DONE
# frame is received.
# 
# Additionally, a client MAY consider the handshake to be confirmed
# when it receives an acknowledgment for a 1-RTT packet.  This can be
# implemented by recording the lowest packet number sent with 1-RTT
# keys and comparing it to the Largest Acknowledged field in any
# received 1-RTT ACK frame: once the latter is greater than or equal to
# the former, the handshake is confirmed.
