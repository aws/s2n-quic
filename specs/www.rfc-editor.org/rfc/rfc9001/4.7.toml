# 4.7.  HelloRetryRequest
#
# The HelloRetryRequest message (see Section 4.1.4 of [TLS13]) can be
# used to request that a client provide new information, such as a key
# share, or to validate some characteristic of the client.  From the
# perspective of QUIC, HelloRetryRequest is not differentiated from
# other cryptographic handshake messages that are carried in Initial
# packets.  Although it is in principle possible to use this feature
# for address verification, QUIC implementations SHOULD instead use the
# Retry feature; see Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
