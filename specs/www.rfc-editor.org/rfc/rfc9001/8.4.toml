# 8.4.  Prohibit TLS Middlebox Compatibility Mode
#
# Appendix D.4 of [TLS13] describes an alteration to the TLS 1.3
# handshake as a workaround for bugs in some middleboxes.  The TLS 1.3
# middlebox compatibility mode involves setting the legacy_session_id
# field to a 32-byte value in the ClientHello and ServerHello, then
# sending a change_cipher_spec record.  Both field and record carry no
# semantic content and are ignored.
# 
# This mode has no use in QUIC as it only applies to middleboxes that
# interfere with TLS over TCP.  QUIC also provides no means to carry a
# change_cipher_spec record.  A client MUST NOT request the use of the
# TLS 1.3 compatibility mode.  A server SHOULD treat the receipt of a
# TLS ClientHello with a non-empty legacy_session_id field as a
# connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
