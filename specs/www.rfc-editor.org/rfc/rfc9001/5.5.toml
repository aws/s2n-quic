# 5.5.  Receiving Protected Packets
#
# Once an endpoint successfully receives a packet with a given packet
# number, it MUST discard all packets in the same packet number space
# with higher packet numbers if they cannot be successfully unprotected
# with either the same key, or -- if there is a key update -- a
# subsequent packet protection key; see Section 6.  Similarly, a packet
# that appears to trigger a key update but cannot be unprotected
# successfully MUST be discarded.
# 
# Failure to unprotect a packet does not necessarily indicate the
# existence of a protocol error in a peer or an attack.  The truncated
# packet number encoding used in QUIC can cause packet numbers to be
# decoded incorrectly if they are delayed significantly.
