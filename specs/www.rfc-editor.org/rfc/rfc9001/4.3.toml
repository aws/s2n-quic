# 4.3.  ClientHello Size
#
# The first Initial packet from a client contains the start or all of
# its first cryptographic handshake message, which for TLS is the
# ClientHello.  Servers might need to parse the entire ClientHello
# (e.g., to access extensions such as Server Name Identification (SNI)
# or Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)) in order to decide
# whether to accept the new incoming QUIC connection.  If the
# ClientHello spans multiple Initial packets, such servers would need
# to buffer the first received fragments, which could consume excessive
# resources if the client's address has not yet been validated.  To
# avoid this, servers MAY use the Retry feature (see Section 8.1 of
# [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) to only buffer partial ClientHello messages from
# clients with a validated address.
# 
# QUIC packet and framing add at least 36 bytes of overhead to the
# ClientHello message.  That overhead increases if the client chooses a
# Source Connection ID field longer than zero bytes.  Overheads also do
# not include the token or a Destination Connection ID longer than 8
# bytes, both of which might be required if a server sends a Retry
# packet.
# 
# A typical TLS ClientHello can easily fit into a 1200-byte packet.
# However, in addition to the overheads added by QUIC, there are
# several variables that could cause this limit to be exceeded.  Large
# session tickets, multiple or large key shares, and long lists of
# supported ciphers, signature algorithms, versions, QUIC transport
# parameters, and other negotiable parameters and extensions could
# cause this message to grow.
# 
# For servers, in addition to connection IDs and tokens, the size of
# TLS session tickets can have an effect on a client's ability to
# connect efficiently.  Minimizing the size of these values increases
# the probability that clients can use them and still fit their entire
# ClientHello message in their first Initial packet.
# 
# The TLS implementation does not need to ensure that the ClientHello
# is large enough to meet QUIC's requirements for datagrams that carry
# Initial packets; see Section 14.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  QUIC
# implementations use PADDING frames or packet coalescing to ensure
# that datagrams are large enough.
