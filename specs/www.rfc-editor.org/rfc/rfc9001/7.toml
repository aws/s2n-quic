# 7.  Security of Initial Messages
#
# Initial packets are not protected with a secret key, so they are
# subject to potential tampering by an attacker.  QUIC provides
# protection against attackers that cannot read packets but does not
# attempt to provide additional protection against attacks where the
# attacker can observe and inject packets.  Some forms of tampering --
# such as modifying the TLS messages themselves -- are detectable, but
# some -- such as modifying ACKs -- are not.
# 
# For example, an attacker could inject a packet containing an ACK
# frame to make it appear that a packet had not been received or to
# create a false impression of the state of the connection (e.g., by
# modifying the ACK Delay).  Note that such a packet could cause a
# legitimate packet to be dropped as a duplicate.  Implementations
# SHOULD use caution in relying on any data that is contained in
# Initial packets that is not otherwise authenticated.
# 
# It is also possible for the attacker to tamper with data that is
# carried in Handshake packets, but because that sort of tampering
# requires modifying TLS handshake messages, any such tampering will
# cause the TLS handshake to fail.
