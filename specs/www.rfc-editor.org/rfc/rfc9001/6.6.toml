# 6.6.  Limits on AEAD Usage
#
# This document sets usage limits for AEAD algorithms to ensure that
# overuse does not give an adversary a disproportionate advantage in
# attacking the confidentiality and integrity of communications when
# using QUIC.
# 
# The usage limits defined in TLS 1.3 exist for protection against
# attacks on confidentiality and apply to successful applications of
# AEAD protection.  The integrity protections in authenticated
# encryption also depend on limiting the number of attempts to forge
# packets.  TLS achieves this by closing connections after any record
# fails an authentication check.  In comparison, QUIC ignores any
# packet that cannot be authenticated, allowing multiple forgery
# attempts.
# 
# QUIC accounts for AEAD confidentiality and integrity limits
# separately.  The confidentiality limit applies to the number of
# packets encrypted with a given key.  The integrity limit applies to
# the number of packets decrypted within a given connection.  Details
# on enforcing these limits for each AEAD algorithm follow below.
# 
# Endpoints MUST count the number of encrypted packets for each set of
# keys.  If the total number of encrypted packets with the same key
# exceeds the confidentiality limit for the selected AEAD, the endpoint
# MUST stop using those keys.  Endpoints MUST initiate a key update
# before sending more protected packets than the confidentiality limit
# for the selected AEAD permits.  If a key update is not possible or
# integrity limits are reached, the endpoint MUST stop using the
# connection and only send stateless resets in response to receiving
# packets.  It is RECOMMENDED that endpoints immediately close the
# connection with a connection error of type AEAD_LIMIT_REACHED before
# reaching a state where key updates are not possible.
# 
# For AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the confidentiality limit
# is 2^23 encrypted packets; see Appendix B.1.  For
# AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, the confidentiality limit is greater than the
# number of possible packets (2^62) and so can be disregarded.  For
# AEAD_AES_128_CCM, the confidentiality limit is 2^21.5 encrypted
# packets; see Appendix B.2.  Applying a limit reduces the probability
# that an attacker can distinguish the AEAD in use from a random
# permutation; see [AEBounds], [ROBUST], and [GCM-MU].
# 
# In addition to counting packets sent, endpoints MUST count the number
# of received packets that fail authentication during the lifetime of a
# connection.  If the total number of received packets that fail
# authentication within the connection, across all keys, exceeds the
# integrity limit for the selected AEAD, the endpoint MUST immediately
# close the connection with a connection error of type
# AEAD_LIMIT_REACHED and not process any more packets.
# 
# For AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the integrity limit is
# 2^52 invalid packets; see Appendix B.1.  For AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305,
# the integrity limit is 2^36 invalid packets; see [AEBounds].  For
# AEAD_AES_128_CCM, the integrity limit is 2^21.5 invalid packets; see
# Appendix B.2.  Applying this limit reduces the probability that an
# attacker can successfully forge a packet; see [AEBounds], [ROBUST],
# and [GCM-MU].
# 
# Endpoints that limit the size of packets MAY use higher
# confidentiality and integrity limits; see Appendix B for details.
# 
# Future analyses and specifications MAY relax confidentiality or
# integrity limits for an AEAD.
# 
# Any TLS cipher suite that is specified for use with QUIC MUST define
# limits on the use of the associated AEAD function that preserves
# margins for confidentiality and integrity.  That is, limits MUST be
# specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and for
# the number of packets that can fail authentication.  Providing a
# reference to any analysis upon which values are based -- and any
# assumptions used in that analysis -- allows limits to be adapted to
# varying usage conditions.
