# 8.3.  Removing the EndOfEarlyData Message
#
# The TLS EndOfEarlyData message is not used with QUIC.  QUIC does not
# rely on this message to mark the end of 0-RTT data or to signal the
# change to Handshake keys.
# 
# Clients MUST NOT send the EndOfEarlyData message.  A server MUST
# treat receipt of a CRYPTO frame in a 0-RTT packet as a connection
# error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# As a result, EndOfEarlyData does not appear in the TLS handshake
# transcript.
