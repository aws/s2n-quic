# 6.  Key Update
#
# Once the handshake is confirmed (see Section 4.1.2), an endpoint MAY
# initiate a key update.
# 
# The Key Phase bit indicates which packet protection keys are used to
# protect the packet.  The Key Phase bit is initially set to 0 for the
# first set of 1-RTT packets and toggled to signal each subsequent key
# update.
# 
# The Key Phase bit allows a recipient to detect a change in keying
# material without needing to receive the first packet that triggered
# the change.  An endpoint that notices a changed Key Phase bit updates
# keys and decrypts the packet that contains the changed value.
# 
# Initiating a key update results in both endpoints updating keys.
# This differs from TLS where endpoints can update keys independently.
# 
# This mechanism replaces the key update mechanism of TLS, which relies
# on KeyUpdate messages sent using 1-RTT encryption keys.  Endpoints
# MUST NOT send a TLS KeyUpdate message.  Endpoints MUST treat the
# receipt of a TLS KeyUpdate message as a connection error of type
# 0x010a, equivalent to a fatal TLS alert of unexpected_message; see
# Section 4.8.
# 
# Figure 9 shows a key update process, where the initial set of keys
# used (identified with @M) are replaced by updated keys (identified
# with @N).  The value of the Key Phase bit is indicated in brackets
# [].
