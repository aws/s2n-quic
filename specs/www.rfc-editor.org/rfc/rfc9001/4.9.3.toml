# 4.9.3.  Discarding 0-RTT Keys
#
# 0-RTT and 1-RTT packets share the same packet number space, and
# clients do not send 0-RTT packets after sending a 1-RTT packet
# (Section 5.6).
# 
# Therefore, a client SHOULD discard 0-RTT keys as soon as it installs
# 1-RTT keys as they have no use after that moment.
# 
# Additionally, a server MAY discard 0-RTT keys as soon as it receives
# a 1-RTT packet.  However, due to packet reordering, a 0-RTT packet
# could arrive after a 1-RTT packet.  Servers MAY temporarily retain
# 0-RTT keys to allow decrypting reordered packets without requiring
# their contents to be retransmitted with 1-RTT keys.  After receiving
# a 1-RTT packet, servers MUST discard 0-RTT keys within a short time;
# the RECOMMENDED time period is three times the Probe Timeout (PTO,
# see [QUIC-RECOVERY]).  A server MAY discard 0-RTT keys earlier if it
# determines that it has received all 0-RTT packets, which can be done
# by keeping track of missing packet numbers.
