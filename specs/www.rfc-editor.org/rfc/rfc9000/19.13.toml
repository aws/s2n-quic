# 19.13.  STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Frames
#
# A sender SHOULD send a STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame (type=0x15) when it
# wishes to send data but is unable to do so due to stream-level flow
# control.  This frame is analogous to DATA_BLOCKED (Section 19.12).
# 
# An endpoint that receives a STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame for a send-only
# stream MUST terminate the connection with error STREAM_STATE_ERROR.
# 
# STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames are formatted as shown in Figure 37.
# 
# STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x15,
#   Stream ID (i),
#   Maximum Stream Data (i),
# }
# 
#              Figure 37: STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Frame Format
# 
# STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Stream ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the stream that is
#    blocked due to flow control.
# 
# Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the offset
#    of the stream at which the blocking occurred.
