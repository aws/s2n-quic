# 7.4.  Transport Parameters
#
# During connection establishment, both endpoints make authenticated
# declarations of their transport parameters.  Endpoints are required
# to comply with the restrictions that each parameter defines; the
# description of each parameter includes rules for its handling.
# 
# Transport parameters are declarations that are made unilaterally by
# each endpoint.  Each endpoint can choose values for transport
# parameters independent of the values chosen by its peer.
# 
# The encoding of the transport parameters is detailed in Section 18.
# 
# QUIC includes the encoded transport parameters in the cryptographic
# handshake.  Once the handshake completes, the transport parameters
# declared by the peer are available.  Each endpoint validates the
# values provided by its peer.
# 
# Definitions for each of the defined transport parameters are included
# in Section 18.2.
# 
# An endpoint MUST treat receipt of a transport parameter with an
# invalid value as a connection error of type
# TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT send a parameter more than once in a given
# transport parameters extension.  An endpoint SHOULD treat receipt of
# duplicate transport parameters as a connection error of type
# TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.
# 
# Endpoints use transport parameters to authenticate the negotiation of
# connection IDs during the handshake; see Section 7.3.
# 
# ALPN (see [ALPN]) allows clients to offer multiple application
# protocols during connection establishment.  The transport parameters
# that a client includes during the handshake apply to all application
# protocols that the client offers.  Application protocols can
# recommend values for transport parameters, such as the initial flow
# control limits.  However, application protocols that set constraints
# on values for transport parameters could make it impossible for a
# client to offer multiple application protocols if these constraints
# conflict.
