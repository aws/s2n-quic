# 3.3.  Permitted Frame Types
#
# The sender of a stream sends just three frame types that affect the
# state of a stream at either the sender or the receiver: STREAM
# (Section 19.8), STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED (Section 19.13), and RESET_STREAM
# (Section 19.4).
# 
# A sender MUST NOT send any of these frames from a terminal state
# ("Data Recvd" or "Reset Recvd").  A sender MUST NOT send a STREAM or
# STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame for a stream in the "Reset Sent" state or
# any terminal state -- that is, after sending a RESET_STREAM frame.  A
# receiver could receive any of these three frames in any state, due to
# the possibility of delayed delivery of packets carrying them.
# 
# The receiver of a stream sends MAX_STREAM_DATA frames (Section 19.10)
# and STOP_SENDING frames (Section 19.5).
# 
# The receiver only sends MAX_STREAM_DATA frames in the "Recv" state.
# A receiver MAY send a STOP_SENDING frame in any state where it has
# not received a RESET_STREAM frame -- that is, states other than
# "Reset Recvd" or "Reset Read".  However, there is little value in
# sending a STOP_SENDING frame in the "Data Recvd" state, as all stream
# data has been received.  A sender could receive either of these two
# types of frames in any state as a result of delayed delivery of
# packets.
