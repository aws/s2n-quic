# 11.1.  Connection Errors
#
# Errors that result in the connection being unusable, such as an
# obvious violation of protocol semantics or corruption of state that
# affects an entire connection, MUST be signaled using a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame (Section 19.19).
# 
# Application-specific protocol errors are signaled using the
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a frame type of 0x1d.  Errors that are
# specific to the transport, including all those described in this
# document, are carried in the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a frame type
# of 0x1c.
# 
# A CONNECTION_CLOSE frame could be sent in a packet that is lost.  An
# endpoint SHOULD be prepared to retransmit a packet containing a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame if it receives more packets on a terminated
# connection.  Limiting the number of retransmissions and the time over
# which this final packet is sent limits the effort expended on
# terminated connections.
# 
# An endpoint that chooses not to retransmit packets containing a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame risks a peer missing the first such packet.
# The only mechanism available to an endpoint that continues to receive
# data for a terminated connection is to attempt the stateless reset
# process (Section 10.3).
# 
# As the AEAD for Initial packets does not provide strong
# authentication, an endpoint MAY discard an invalid Initial packet.
# Discarding an Initial packet is permitted even where this
# specification otherwise mandates a connection error.  An endpoint can
# only discard a packet if it does not process the frames in the packet
# or reverts the effects of any processing.  Discarding invalid Initial
# packets might be used to reduce exposure to denial of service; see
# Section 21.2.
