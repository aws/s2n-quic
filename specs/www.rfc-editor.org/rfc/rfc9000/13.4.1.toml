# 13.4.1.  Reporting ECN Counts
#
# The use of ECN requires the receiving endpoint to read the ECN field
# from an IP packet, which is not possible on all platforms.  If an
# endpoint does not implement ECN support or does not have access to
# received ECN fields, it does not report ECN counts for packets it
# receives.
# 
# Even if an endpoint does not set an ECT field in packets it sends,
# the endpoint MUST provide feedback about ECN markings it receives, if
# these are accessible.  Failing to report the ECN counts will cause
# the sender to disable the use of ECN for this connection.
# 
# On receiving an IP packet with an ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE
# codepoint, an ECN-enabled endpoint accesses the ECN field and
# increases the corresponding ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE count.  These
# ECN counts are included in subsequent ACK frames; see Sections 13.2
# and 19.3.
# 
# Each packet number space maintains separate acknowledgment state and
# separate ECN counts.  Coalesced QUIC packets (see Section 12.2) share
# the same IP header so the ECN counts are incremented once for each
# coalesced QUIC packet.
# 
# For example, if one each of an Initial, Handshake, and 1-RTT QUIC
# packet are coalesced into a single UDP datagram, the ECN counts for
# all three packet number spaces will be incremented by one each, based
# on the ECN field of the single IP header.
# 
# ECN counts are only incremented when QUIC packets from the received
# IP packet are processed.  As such, duplicate QUIC packets are not
# processed and do not increase ECN counts; see Section 21.10 for
# relevant security concerns.
