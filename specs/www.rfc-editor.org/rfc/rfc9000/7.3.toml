# 7.3.  Authenticating Connection IDs
#
# The choice each endpoint makes about connection IDs during the
# handshake is authenticated by including all values in transport
# parameters; see Section 7.4.  This ensures that all connection IDs
# used for the handshake are also authenticated by the cryptographic
# handshake.
# 
# Each endpoint includes the value of the Source Connection ID field
# from the first Initial packet it sent in the
# initial_source_connection_id transport parameter; see Section 18.2.
# A server includes the Destination Connection ID field from the first
# Initial packet it received from the client in the
# original_destination_connection_id transport parameter; if the server
# sent a Retry packet, this refers to the first Initial packet received
# before sending the Retry packet.  If it sends a Retry packet, a
# server also includes the Source Connection ID field from the Retry
# packet in the retry_source_connection_id transport parameter.
# 
# The values provided by a peer for these transport parameters MUST
# match the values that an endpoint used in the Destination and Source
# Connection ID fields of Initial packets that it sent (and received,
# for servers).  Endpoints MUST validate that received transport
# parameters match received connection ID values.  Including connection
# ID values in transport parameters and verifying them ensures that an
# attacker cannot influence the choice of connection ID for a
# successful connection by injecting packets carrying attacker-chosen
# connection IDs during the handshake.
# 
# An endpoint MUST treat the absence of the
# initial_source_connection_id transport parameter from either endpoint
# or the absence of the original_destination_connection_id transport
# parameter from the server as a connection error of type
# TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.
# 
# An endpoint MUST treat the following as a connection error of type
# TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR or PROTOCOL_VIOLATION:
# 
# *  absence of the retry_source_connection_id transport parameter from
#    the server after receiving a Retry packet,
# 
# *  presence of the retry_source_connection_id transport parameter
#    when no Retry packet was received, or
# 
# *  a mismatch between values received from a peer in these transport
#    parameters and the value sent in the corresponding Destination or
#    Source Connection ID fields of Initial packets.
# 
# If a zero-length connection ID is selected, the corresponding
# transport parameter is included with a zero-length value.
# 
# Figure 7 shows the connection IDs (with DCID=Destination Connection
# ID, SCID=Source Connection ID) that are used in a complete handshake.
# The exchange of Initial packets is shown, plus the later exchange of
# 1-RTT packets that includes the connection ID established during the
# handshake.

# Client                                                  Server
# 
# Initial: DCID=S1, SCID=C1 ->
#                                   <- Initial: DCID=C1, SCID=S3
#                              ...
# 1-RTT: DCID=S3 ->
#                                              <- 1-RTT: DCID=C1
# 
#             Figure 7: Use of Connection IDs in a Handshake
# 
# Figure 8 shows a similar handshake that includes a Retry packet.
# 
# Client                                                  Server
# 
# Initial: DCID=S1, SCID=C1 ->
#                                     <- Retry: DCID=C1, SCID=S2
# Initial: DCID=S2, SCID=C1 ->
#                                   <- Initial: DCID=C1, SCID=S3
#                              ...
# 1-RTT: DCID=S3 ->
#                                              <- 1-RTT: DCID=C1
# 
#       Figure 8: Use of Connection IDs in a Handshake with Retry
# 
# In both cases (Figures 7 and 8), the client sets the value of the
# initial_source_connection_id transport parameter to "C1".
# 
# When the handshake does not include a Retry (Figure 7), the server
# sets original_destination_connection_id to "S1" (note that this value
# is chosen by the client) and initial_source_connection_id to "S3".
# In this case, the server does not include a
# retry_source_connection_id transport parameter.
# 
# When the handshake includes a Retry (Figure 8), the server sets
# original_destination_connection_id to "S1",
# retry_source_connection_id to "S2", and initial_source_connection_id
# to "S3".
