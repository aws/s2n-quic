# 19.11.  MAX_STREAMS Frames
#
# A MAX_STREAMS frame (type=0x12 or 0x13) informs the peer of the
# cumulative number of streams of a given type it is permitted to open.
# A MAX_STREAMS frame with a type of 0x12 applies to bidirectional
# streams, and a MAX_STREAMS frame with a type of 0x13 applies to
# unidirectional streams.
# 
# MAX_STREAMS frames are formatted as shown in Figure 35.
# 
# MAX_STREAMS Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x12..0x13,
#   Maximum Streams (i),
# }
# 
#                  Figure 35: MAX_STREAMS Frame Format
# 
# MAX_STREAMS frames contain the following field:
# 
# Maximum Streams:  A count of the cumulative number of streams of the
#    corresponding type that can be opened over the lifetime of the
#    connection.  This value cannot exceed 2^60, as it is not possible
#    to encode stream IDs larger than 2^62-1.  Receipt of a frame that
#    permits opening of a stream larger than this limit MUST be treated
#    as a connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.
# 
# Loss or reordering can cause an endpoint to receive a MAX_STREAMS
# frame with a lower stream limit than was previously received.
# MAX_STREAMS frames that do not increase the stream limit MUST be
# ignored.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT open more streams than permitted by the current
# stream limit set by its peer.  For instance, a server that receives a
# unidirectional stream limit of 3 is permitted to open streams 3, 7,
# and 11, but not stream 15.  An endpoint MUST terminate a connection
# with an error of type STREAM_LIMIT_ERROR if a peer opens more streams
# than was permitted.  This includes violations of remembered limits in
# Early Data; see Section 7.4.1.
# 
# Note that these frames (and the corresponding transport parameters)
# do not describe the number of streams that can be opened
# concurrently.  The limit includes streams that have been closed as
# well as those that are open.
