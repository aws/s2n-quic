# 9.6.  Server's Preferred Address
#
# QUIC allows servers to accept connections on one IP address and
# attempt to transfer these connections to a more preferred address
# shortly after the handshake.  This is particularly useful when
# clients initially connect to an address shared by multiple servers
# but would prefer to use a unicast address to ensure connection
# stability.  This section describes the protocol for migrating a
# connection to a preferred server address.
# 
# Migrating a connection to a new server address mid-connection is not
# supported by the version of QUIC specified in this document.  If a
# client receives packets from a new server address when the client has
# not initiated a migration to that address, the client SHOULD discard
# these packets.
