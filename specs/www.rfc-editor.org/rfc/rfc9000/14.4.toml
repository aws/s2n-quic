# 14.4.  Sending QUIC PMTU Probes
#
# PMTU probes are ack-eliciting packets.
# 
# Endpoints could limit the content of PMTU probes to PING and PADDING
# frames, since packets that are larger than the current maximum
# datagram size are more likely to be dropped by the network.  Loss of
# a QUIC packet that is carried in a PMTU probe is therefore not a
# reliable indication of congestion and SHOULD NOT trigger a congestion
# control reaction; see Item 7 in Section 3 of [DPLPMTUD].  However,
# PMTU probes consume congestion window, which could delay subsequent
# transmission by an application.
