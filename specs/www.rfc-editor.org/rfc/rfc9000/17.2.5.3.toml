# 17.2.5.3.  Continuing a Handshake after Retry
#
# Subsequent Initial packets from the client include the connection ID
# and token values from the Retry packet.  The client copies the Source
# Connection ID field from the Retry packet to the Destination
# Connection ID field and uses this value until an Initial packet with
# an updated value is received; see Section 7.2.  The value of the
# Token field is copied to all subsequent Initial packets; see
# Section 8.1.2.
# 
# Other than updating the Destination Connection ID and Token fields,
# the Initial packet sent by the client is subject to the same
# restrictions as the first Initial packet.  A client MUST use the same
# cryptographic handshake message it included in this packet.  A server
# MAY treat a packet that contains a different cryptographic handshake
# message as a connection error or discard it.  Note that including a
# Token field reduces the available space for the cryptographic
# handshake message, which might result in the client needing to send
# multiple Initial packets.
# 
# A client MAY attempt 0-RTT after receiving a Retry packet by sending
# 0-RTT packets to the connection ID provided by the server.
# 
# A client MUST NOT reset the packet number for any packet number space
# after processing a Retry packet.  In particular, 0-RTT packets
# contain confidential information that will most likely be
# retransmitted on receiving a Retry packet.  The keys used to protect
# these new 0-RTT packets will not change as a result of responding to
# a Retry packet.  However, the data sent in these packets could be
# different than what was sent earlier.  Sending these new packets with
# the same packet number is likely to compromise the packet protection
# for those packets because the same key and nonce could be used to
# protect different content.  A server MAY abort the connection if it
# detects that the client reset the packet number.
# 
# The connection IDs used in Initial and Retry packets exchanged
# between client and server are copied to the transport parameters and
# validated as described in Section 7.3.
