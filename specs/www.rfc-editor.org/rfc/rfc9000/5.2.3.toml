# 5.2.3.  Considerations for Simple Load Balancers
#
# A server deployment could load-balance among servers using only
# source and destination IP addresses and ports.  Changes to the
# client's IP address or port could result in packets being forwarded
# to the wrong server.  Such a server deployment could use one of the
# following methods for connection continuity when a client's address
# changes.
# 
# *  Servers could use an out-of-band mechanism to forward packets to
#    the correct server based on connection ID.
# 
# *  If servers can use a dedicated server IP address or port, other
#    than the one that the client initially connects to, they could use
#    the preferred_address transport parameter to request that clients
#    move connections to that dedicated address.  Note that clients
#    could choose not to use the preferred address.
# 
# A server in a deployment that does not implement a solution to
# maintain connection continuity when the client address changes SHOULD
# indicate that migration is not supported by using the
# disable_active_migration transport parameter.  The
# disable_active_migration transport parameter does not prohibit
# connection migration after a client has acted on a preferred_address
# transport parameter.
# 
# Server deployments that use this simple form of load balancing MUST
# avoid the creation of a stateless reset oracle; see Section 21.11.
