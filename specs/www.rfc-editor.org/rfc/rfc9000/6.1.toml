# 6.1.  Sending Version Negotiation Packets
#
# If the version selected by the client is not acceptable to the
# server, the server responds with a Version Negotiation packet; see
# Section 17.2.1.  This includes a list of versions that the server
# will accept.  An endpoint MUST NOT send a Version Negotiation packet
# in response to receiving a Version Negotiation packet.
# 
# This system allows a server to process packets with unsupported
# versions without retaining state.  Though either the Initial packet
# or the Version Negotiation packet that is sent in response could be
# lost, the client will send new packets until it successfully receives
# a response or it abandons the connection attempt.
# 
# A server MAY limit the number of Version Negotiation packets it
# sends.  For instance, a server that is able to recognize packets as
# 0-RTT might choose not to send Version Negotiation packets in
# response to 0-RTT packets with the expectation that it will
# eventually receive an Initial packet.
