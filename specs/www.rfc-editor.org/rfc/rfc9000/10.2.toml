# 10.2.  Immediate Close
#
# An endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame (Section 19.19) to
# terminate the connection immediately.  A CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
# causes all streams to immediately become closed; open streams can be
# assumed to be implicitly reset.
# 
# After sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, an endpoint immediately
# enters the closing state; see Section 10.2.1.  After receiving a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, endpoints enter the draining state; see
# Section 10.2.2.
# 
# Violations of the protocol lead to an immediate close.
# 
# An immediate close can be used after an application protocol has
# arranged to close a connection.  This might be after the application
# protocol negotiates a graceful shutdown.  The application protocol
# can exchange messages that are needed for both application endpoints
# to agree that the connection can be closed, after which the
# application requests that QUIC close the connection.  When QUIC
# consequently closes the connection, a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with an
# application-supplied error code will be used to signal closure to the
# peer.
# 
# The closing and draining connection states exist to ensure that
# connections close cleanly and that delayed or reordered packets are
# properly discarded.  These states SHOULD persist for at least three
# times the current PTO interval as defined in [QUIC-RECOVERY].
# 
# Disposing of connection state prior to exiting the closing or
# draining state could result in an endpoint generating a Stateless
# Reset unnecessarily when it receives a late-arriving packet.
# Endpoints that have some alternative means to ensure that late-
# arriving packets do not induce a response, such as those that are
# able to close the UDP socket, MAY end these states earlier to allow
# for faster resource recovery.  Servers that retain an open socket for
# accepting new connections SHOULD NOT end the closing or draining
# state early.
# 
# Once its closing or draining state ends, an endpoint SHOULD discard
# all connection state.  The endpoint MAY send a Stateless Reset in
# response to any further incoming packets belonging to this
# connection.
