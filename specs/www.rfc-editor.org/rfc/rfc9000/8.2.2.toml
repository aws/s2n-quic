# 8.2.2.  Path Validation Responses
#
# On receiving a PATH_CHALLENGE frame, an endpoint MUST respond by
# echoing the data contained in the PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a
# PATH_RESPONSE frame.  An endpoint MUST NOT delay transmission of a
# packet containing a PATH_RESPONSE frame unless constrained by
# congestion control.
# 
# A PATH_RESPONSE frame MUST be sent on the network path where the
# PATH_CHALLENGE frame was received.  This ensures that path validation
# by a peer only succeeds if the path is functional in both directions.
# This requirement MUST NOT be enforced by the endpoint that initiates
# path validation, as that would enable an attack on migration; see
# Section 9.3.3.
# 
# An endpoint MUST expand datagrams that contain a PATH_RESPONSE frame
# to at least the smallest allowed maximum datagram size of 1200 bytes.
# This verifies that the path is able to carry datagrams of this size
# in both directions.  However, an endpoint MUST NOT expand the
# datagram containing the PATH_RESPONSE if the resulting data exceeds
# the anti-amplification limit.  This is expected to only occur if the
# received PATH_CHALLENGE was not sent in an expanded datagram.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT send more than one PATH_RESPONSE frame in
# response to one PATH_CHALLENGE frame; see Section 13.3.  The peer is
# expected to send more PATH_CHALLENGE frames as necessary to evoke
# additional PATH_RESPONSE frames.
