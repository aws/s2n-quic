# 13.2.7.  PADDING Frames Consume Congestion Window
#
# Packets containing PADDING frames are considered to be in flight for
# congestion control purposes [QUIC-RECOVERY].  Packets containing only
# PADDING frames therefore consume congestion window but do not
# generate acknowledgments that will open the congestion window.  To
# avoid a deadlock, a sender SHOULD ensure that other frames are sent
# periodically in addition to PADDING frames to elicit acknowledgments
# from the receiver.
