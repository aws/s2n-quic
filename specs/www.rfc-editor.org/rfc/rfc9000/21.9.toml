# 21.9.  Peer Denial of Service
#
# QUIC and TLS both contain frames or messages that have legitimate
# uses in some contexts, but these frames or messages can be abused to
# cause a peer to expend processing resources without having any
# observable impact on the state of the connection.
# 
# Messages can also be used to change and revert state in small or
# inconsequential ways, such as by sending small increments to flow
# control limits.
# 
# If processing costs are disproportionately large in comparison to
# bandwidth consumption or effect on state, then this could allow a
# malicious peer to exhaust processing capacity.
# 
# While there are legitimate uses for all messages, implementations
# SHOULD track cost of processing relative to progress and treat
# excessive quantities of any non-productive packets as indicative of
# an attack.  Endpoints MAY respond to this condition with a connection
# error or by dropping packets.
