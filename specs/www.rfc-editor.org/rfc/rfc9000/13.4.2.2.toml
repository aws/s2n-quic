# 13.4.2.2.  ECN Validation Outcomes
#
# If validation fails, then the endpoint MUST disable ECN.  It stops
# setting the ECT codepoint in IP packets that it sends, assuming that
# either the network path or the peer does not support ECN.
# 
# Even if validation fails, an endpoint MAY revalidate ECN for the same
# path at any later time in the connection.  An endpoint could continue
# to periodically attempt validation.
# 
# Upon successful validation, an endpoint MAY continue to set an ECT
# codepoint in subsequent packets it sends, with the expectation that
# the path is ECN capable.  Network routing and path elements can
# change mid-connection; an endpoint MUST disable ECN if validation
# later fails.
