# 9.6.3.  Interaction of Client Migration and Preferred Address
#
# A client might need to perform a connection migration before it has
# migrated to the server's preferred address.  In this case, the client
# SHOULD perform path validation to both the original and preferred
# server address from the client's new address concurrently.
# 
# If path validation of the server's preferred address succeeds, the
# client MUST abandon validation of the original address and migrate to
# using the server's preferred address.  If path validation of the
# server's preferred address fails but validation of the server's
# original address succeeds, the client MAY migrate to its new address
# and continue sending to the server's original address.
# 
# If packets received at the server's preferred address have a
# different source address than observed from the client during the
# handshake, the server MUST protect against potential attacks as
# described in Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2.  In addition to intentional
# simultaneous migration, this might also occur because the client's
# access network used a different NAT binding for the server's
# preferred address.
# 
# Servers SHOULD initiate path validation to the client's new address
# upon receiving a probe packet from a different address; see
# Section 8.
# 
# A client that migrates to a new address SHOULD use a preferred
# address from the same address family for the server.
# 
# The connection ID provided in the preferred_address transport
# parameter is not specific to the addresses that are provided.  This
# connection ID is provided to ensure that the client has a connection
# ID available for migration, but the client MAY use this connection ID
# on any path.
