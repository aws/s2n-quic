# 19.8.  STREAM Frames
#
# STREAM frames implicitly create a stream and carry stream data.  The
# Type field in the STREAM frame takes the form 0b00001XXX (or the set
# of values from 0x08 to 0x0f).  The three low-order bits of the frame
# type determine the fields that are present in the frame:
# 
# *  The OFF bit (0x04) in the frame type is set to indicate that there
#    is an Offset field present.  When set to 1, the Offset field is
#    present.  When set to 0, the Offset field is absent and the Stream
#    Data starts at an offset of 0 (that is, the frame contains the
#    first bytes of the stream, or the end of a stream that includes no
#    data).
# 
# *  The LEN bit (0x02) in the frame type is set to indicate that there
#    is a Length field present.  If this bit is set to 0, the Length
#    field is absent and the Stream Data field extends to the end of
#    the packet.  If this bit is set to 1, the Length field is present.
# 
# *  The FIN bit (0x01) indicates that the frame marks the end of the
#    stream.  The final size of the stream is the sum of the offset and
#    the length of this frame.
# 
# An endpoint MUST terminate the connection with error
# STREAM_STATE_ERROR if it receives a STREAM frame for a locally
# initiated stream that has not yet been created, or for a send-only
# stream.
# 
# STREAM frames are formatted as shown in Figure 32.
# 
# STREAM Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x08..0x0f,
#   Stream ID (i),
#   [Offset (i)],
#   [Length (i)],
#   Stream Data (..),
# }
# 
#                     Figure 32: STREAM Frame Format
# 
# STREAM frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Stream ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the stream ID of the
#    stream; see Section 2.1.
# 
# Offset:  A variable-length integer specifying the byte offset in the
#    stream for the data in this STREAM frame.  This field is present
#    when the OFF bit is set to 1.  When the Offset field is absent,
#    the offset is 0.
# 
# Length:  A variable-length integer specifying the length of the
#    Stream Data field in this STREAM frame.  This field is present
#    when the LEN bit is set to 1.  When the LEN bit is set to 0, the
#    Stream Data field consumes all the remaining bytes in the packet.
# 
# Stream Data:  The bytes from the designated stream to be delivered.
# 
# When a Stream Data field has a length of 0, the offset in the STREAM
# frame is the offset of the next byte that would be sent.
# 
# The first byte in the stream has an offset of 0.  The largest offset
# delivered on a stream -- the sum of the offset and data length --
# cannot exceed 2^62-1, as it is not possible to provide flow control
# credit for that data.  Receipt of a frame that exceeds this limit
# MUST be treated as a connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR or
# FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR.
