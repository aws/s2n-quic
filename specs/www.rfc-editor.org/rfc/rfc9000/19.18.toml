#
# A PATH_RESPONSE frame (type=0x1b) is sent in response to a
# PATH_CHALLENGE frame.
# 
# PATH_RESPONSE frames are formatted as shown in Figure 42.  The format
# of a PATH_RESPONSE frame is identical to that of the PATH_CHALLENGE
# frame; see Section 19.17.
# 
# PATH_RESPONSE Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x1b,
#   Data (64),
# }

#                 Figure 42: PATH_RESPONSE Frame Format
# 
# If the content of a PATH_RESPONSE frame does not match the content of
# a PATH_CHALLENGE frame previously sent by the endpoint, the endpoint
# MAY generate a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
