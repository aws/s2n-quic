# 4.5.  Stream Final Size
#
# The final size is the amount of flow control credit that is consumed
# by a stream.  Assuming that every contiguous byte on the stream was
# sent once, the final size is the number of bytes sent.  More
# generally, this is one higher than the offset of the byte with the
# largest offset sent on the stream, or zero if no bytes were sent.
# 
# A sender always communicates the final size of a stream to the
# receiver reliably, no matter how the stream is terminated.  The final
# size is the sum of the Offset and Length fields of a STREAM frame
# with a FIN flag, noting that these fields might be implicit.
# Alternatively, the Final Size field of a RESET_STREAM frame carries
# this value.  This guarantees that both endpoints agree on how much
# flow control credit was consumed by the sender on that stream.
# 
# An endpoint will know the final size for a stream when the receiving
# part of the stream enters the "Size Known" or "Reset Recvd" state
# (Section 3).  The receiver MUST use the final size of the stream to
# account for all bytes sent on the stream in its connection-level flow
# controller.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT send data on a stream at or beyond the final
# size.
# 
# Once a final size for a stream is known, it cannot change.  If a
# RESET_STREAM or STREAM frame is received indicating a change in the
# final size for the stream, an endpoint SHOULD respond with an error
# of type FINAL_SIZE_ERROR; see Section 11 for details on error
# handling.  A receiver SHOULD treat receipt of data at or beyond the
# final size as an error of type FINAL_SIZE_ERROR, even after a stream
# is closed.  Generating these errors is not mandatory, because
# requiring that an endpoint generate these errors also means that the
# endpoint needs to maintain the final size state for closed streams,
# which could mean a significant state commitment.
