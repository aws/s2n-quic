# 11.2.  Stream Errors
#
# If an application-level error affects a single stream but otherwise
# leaves the connection in a recoverable state, the endpoint can send a
# RESET_STREAM frame (Section 19.4) with an appropriate error code to
# terminate just the affected stream.
# 
# Resetting a stream without the involvement of the application
# protocol could cause the application protocol to enter an
# unrecoverable state.  RESET_STREAM MUST only be instigated by the
# application protocol that uses QUIC.
# 
# The semantics of the application error code carried in RESET_STREAM
# are defined by the application protocol.  Only the application
# protocol is able to cause a stream to be terminated.  A local
# instance of the application protocol uses a direct API call, and a
# remote instance uses the STOP_SENDING frame, which triggers an
# automatic RESET_STREAM.
# 
# Application protocols SHOULD define rules for handling streams that
# are prematurely canceled by either endpoint.
