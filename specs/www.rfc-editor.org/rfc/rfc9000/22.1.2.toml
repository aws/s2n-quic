# 22.1.2.  Selecting Codepoints
#
# New requests for codepoints from QUIC registries SHOULD use a
# randomly selected codepoint that excludes both existing allocations
# and the first unallocated codepoint in the selected space.  Requests
# for multiple codepoints MAY use a contiguous range.  This minimizes
# the risk that differing semantics are attributed to the same
# codepoint by different implementations.
# 
# The use of the first unassigned codepoint is reserved for allocation
# using the Standards Action policy; see Section 4.9 of [RFC8126].  The
# early codepoint assignment process [EARLY-ASSIGN] can be used for
# these values.
# 
# For codepoints that are encoded in variable-length integers
# (Section 16), such as frame types, codepoints that encode to four or
# eight bytes (that is, values 2^14 and above) SHOULD be used unless
# the usage is especially sensitive to having a longer encoding.
# 
# Applications to register codepoints in QUIC registries MAY include a
# requested codepoint as part of the registration.  IANA MUST allocate
# the selected codepoint if the codepoint is unassigned and the
# requirements of the registration policy are met.
