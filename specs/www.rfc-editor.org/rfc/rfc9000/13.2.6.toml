# 13.2.6.  ACK Frames and Packet Protection
#
# ACK frames MUST only be carried in a packet that has the same packet
# number space as the packet being acknowledged; see Section 12.1.  For
# instance, packets that are protected with 1-RTT keys MUST be
# acknowledged in packets that are also protected with 1-RTT keys.
# 
# Packets that a client sends with 0-RTT packet protection MUST be
# acknowledged by the server in packets protected by 1-RTT keys.  This
# can mean that the client is unable to use these acknowledgments if
# the server cryptographic handshake messages are delayed or lost.
# Note that the same limitation applies to other data sent by the
# server protected by the 1-RTT keys.
