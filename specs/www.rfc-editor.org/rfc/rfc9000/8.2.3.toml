# 8.2.3.  Successful Path Validation
#
# Path validation succeeds when a PATH_RESPONSE frame is received that
# contains the data that was sent in a previous PATH_CHALLENGE frame.
# A PATH_RESPONSE frame received on any network path validates the path
# on which the PATH_CHALLENGE was sent.
# 
# If an endpoint sends a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a datagram that is not
# expanded to at least 1200 bytes and if the response to it validates
# the peer address, the path is validated but not the path MTU.  As a
# result, the endpoint can now send more than three times the amount of
# data that has been received.  However, the endpoint MUST initiate
# another path validation with an expanded datagram to verify that the
# path supports the required MTU.
# 
# Receipt of an acknowledgment for a packet containing a PATH_CHALLENGE
# frame is not adequate validation, since the acknowledgment can be
# spoofed by a malicious peer.
