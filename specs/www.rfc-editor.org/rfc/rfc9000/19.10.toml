# 19.10.  MAX_STREAM_DATA Frames
#
# A MAX_STREAM_DATA frame (type=0x11) is used in flow control to inform
# a peer of the maximum amount of data that can be sent on a stream.
# 
# A MAX_STREAM_DATA frame can be sent for streams in the "Recv" state;
# see Section 3.2.  Receiving a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for a locally
# initiated stream that has not yet been created MUST be treated as a
# connection error of type STREAM_STATE_ERROR.  An endpoint that
# receives a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for a receive-only stream MUST
# terminate the connection with error STREAM_STATE_ERROR.
# 
# MAX_STREAM_DATA frames are formatted as shown in Figure 34.
# 
# MAX_STREAM_DATA Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x11,
#   Stream ID (i),
#   Maximum Stream Data (i),
# }
# 
#                Figure 34: MAX_STREAM_DATA Frame Format
# 
# MAX_STREAM_DATA frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Stream ID:  The stream ID of the affected stream, encoded as a
#    variable-length integer.
# 
# Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the
#    maximum amount of data that can be sent on the identified stream,
#    in units of bytes.
# 
# When counting data toward this limit, an endpoint accounts for the
# largest received offset of data that is sent or received on the
# stream.  Loss or reordering can mean that the largest received offset
# on a stream can be greater than the total size of data received on
# that stream.  Receiving STREAM frames might not increase the largest
# received offset.
# 
# The data sent on a stream MUST NOT exceed the largest maximum stream
# data value advertised by the receiver.  An endpoint MUST terminate a
# connection with an error of type FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR if it receives
# more data than the largest maximum stream data that it has sent for
# the affected stream.  This includes violations of remembered limits
# in Early Data; see Section 7.4.1.
