# 19.9.  MAX_DATA Frames
#
# A MAX_DATA frame (type=0x10) is used in flow control to inform the
# peer of the maximum amount of data that can be sent on the connection
# as a whole.
# 
# MAX_DATA frames are formatted as shown in Figure 33.
# 
# MAX_DATA Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x10,
#   Maximum Data (i),
# }
# 
#                    Figure 33: MAX_DATA Frame Format
# 
# MAX_DATA frames contain the following field:
# 
# Maximum Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the maximum
#    amount of data that can be sent on the entire connection, in units
#    of bytes.
# 
# All data sent in STREAM frames counts toward this limit.  The sum of
# the final sizes on all streams -- including streams in terminal
# states -- MUST NOT exceed the value advertised by a receiver.  An
# endpoint MUST terminate a connection with an error of type
# FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR if it receives more data than the maximum data
# value that it has sent.  This includes violations of remembered
# limits in Early Data; see Section 7.4.1.
