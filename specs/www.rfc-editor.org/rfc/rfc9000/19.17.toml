# 19.17.  PATH_CHALLENGE Frames
#
# Endpoints can use PATH_CHALLENGE frames (type=0x1a) to check
# reachability to the peer and for path validation during connection
# migration.
# 
# PATH_CHALLENGE frames are formatted as shown in Figure 41.
# 
# PATH_CHALLENGE Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x1a,
#   Data (64),
# }
# 
#                 Figure 41: PATH_CHALLENGE Frame Format
# 
# PATH_CHALLENGE frames contain the following field:
# 
# Data:  This 8-byte field contains arbitrary data.
# 
# Including 64 bits of entropy in a PATH_CHALLENGE frame ensures that
# it is easier to receive the packet than it is to guess the value
# correctly.
# 
# The recipient of this frame MUST generate a PATH_RESPONSE frame
# (Section 19.18) containing the same Data value.
