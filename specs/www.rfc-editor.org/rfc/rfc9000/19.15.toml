# 19.15.  NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frames
#
# An endpoint sends a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (type=0x18) to provide
# its peer with alternative connection IDs that can be used to break
# linkability when migrating connections; see Section 9.5.
# 
# NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames are formatted as shown in Figure 39.
# 
# NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x18,
#   Sequence Number (i),
#   Retire Prior To (i),
#   Length (8),
#   Connection ID (8..160),
#   Stateless Reset Token (128),
# }
# 
#               Figure 39: NEW_CONNECTION_ID Frame Format
# 
# NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames contain the following fields:
# 
# Sequence Number:  The sequence number assigned to the connection ID
#    by the sender, encoded as a variable-length integer; see
#    Section 5.1.1.
# 
# Retire Prior To:  A variable-length integer indicating which
#    connection IDs should be retired; see Section 5.1.2.
# 
# Length:  An 8-bit unsigned integer containing the length of the
#    connection ID.  Values less than 1 and greater than 20 are invalid
#    and MUST be treated as a connection error of type
#    FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.
# 
# Connection ID:  A connection ID of the specified length.
# 
# Stateless Reset Token:  A 128-bit value that will be used for a
#    stateless reset when the associated connection ID is used; see
#    Section 10.3.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT send this frame if it currently requires that
# its peer send packets with a zero-length Destination Connection ID.
# Changing the length of a connection ID to or from zero length makes
# it difficult to identify when the value of the connection ID changed.
# An endpoint that is sending packets with a zero-length Destination
# Connection ID MUST treat receipt of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame as a
# connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# Transmission errors, timeouts, and retransmissions might cause the
# same NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to be received multiple times.  Receipt
# of the same frame multiple times MUST NOT be treated as a connection
# error.  A receiver can use the sequence number supplied in the
# NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to handle receiving the same
# NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame multiple times.
# 
# If an endpoint receives a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame that repeats a
# previously issued connection ID with a different Stateless Reset
# Token field value or a different Sequence Number field value, or if a
# sequence number is used for different connection IDs, the endpoint
# MAY treat that receipt as a connection error of type
# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# The Retire Prior To field applies to connection IDs established
# during connection setup and the preferred_address transport
# parameter; see Section 5.1.2.  The value in the Retire Prior To field
# MUST be less than or equal to the value in the Sequence Number field.
# Receiving a value in the Retire Prior To field that is greater than
# that in the Sequence Number field MUST be treated as a connection
# error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.
# 
# Once a sender indicates a Retire Prior To value, smaller values sent
# in subsequent NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames have no effect.  A receiver
# MUST ignore any Retire Prior To fields that do not increase the
# largest received Retire Prior To value.
# 
# An endpoint that receives a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with a sequence
# number smaller than the Retire Prior To field of a previously
# received NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame MUST send a corresponding
# RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame that retires the newly received connection
# ID, unless it has already done so for that sequence number.
