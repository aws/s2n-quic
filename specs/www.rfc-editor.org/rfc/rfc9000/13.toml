# 13.  Packetization and Reliability
#
# A sender sends one or more frames in a QUIC packet; see Section 12.4.
# 
# A sender can minimize per-packet bandwidth and computational costs by
# including as many frames as possible in each QUIC packet.  A sender
# MAY wait for a short period of time to collect multiple frames before
# sending a packet that is not maximally packed, to avoid sending out
# large numbers of small packets.  An implementation MAY use knowledge
# about application sending behavior or heuristics to determine whether
# and for how long to wait.  This waiting period is an implementation
# decision, and an implementation should be careful to delay
# conservatively, since any delay is likely to increase application-
# visible latency.
# 
# Stream multiplexing is achieved by interleaving STREAM frames from
# multiple streams into one or more QUIC packets.  A single QUIC packet
# can include multiple STREAM frames from one or more streams.
# 
# One of the benefits of QUIC is avoidance of head-of-line blocking
# across multiple streams.  When a packet loss occurs, only streams
# with data in that packet are blocked waiting for a retransmission to
# be received, while other streams can continue making progress.  Note
# that when data from multiple streams is included in a single QUIC
# packet, loss of that packet blocks all those streams from making
# progress.  Implementations are advised to include as few streams as
# necessary in outgoing packets without losing transmission efficiency
# to underfilled packets.
