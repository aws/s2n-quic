# 10.2.2.  Draining Connection State
#
# The draining state is entered once an endpoint receives a
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, which indicates that its peer is closing or
# draining.  While otherwise identical to the closing state, an
# endpoint in the draining state MUST NOT send any packets.  Retaining
# packet protection keys is unnecessary once a connection is in the
# draining state.
# 
# An endpoint that receives a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame MAY send a single
# packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame before entering the
# draining state, using a NO_ERROR code if appropriate.  An endpoint
# MUST NOT send further packets.  Doing so could result in a constant
# exchange of CONNECTION_CLOSE frames until one of the endpoints exits
# the closing state.
# 
# An endpoint MAY enter the draining state from the closing state if it
# receives a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, which indicates that the peer is
# also closing or draining.  In this case, the draining state ends when
# the closing state would have ended.  In other words, the endpoint
# uses the same end time but ceases transmission of any packets on this
# connection.
