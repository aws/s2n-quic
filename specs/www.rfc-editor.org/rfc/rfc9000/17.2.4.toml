# 17.2.4.  Handshake Packet
#
# A Handshake packet uses long headers with a type value of 0x02,
# followed by the Length and Packet Number fields; see Section 17.2.
# The first byte contains the Reserved and Packet Number Length bits;
# see Section 17.2.  It is used to carry cryptographic handshake
# messages and acknowledgments from the server and client.
# 
# Handshake Packet {
#   Header Form (1) = 1,
#   Fixed Bit (1) = 1,
#   Long Packet Type (2) = 2,
#   Reserved Bits (2),
#   Packet Number Length (2),
#   Version (32),
#   Destination Connection ID Length (8),
#   Destination Connection ID (0..160),
#   Source Connection ID Length (8),
#   Source Connection ID (0..160),
#   Length (i),
#   Packet Number (8..32),
#   Packet Payload (8..),
# }
# 
#                 Figure 17: Handshake Protected Packet
# 
# Once a client has received a Handshake packet from a server, it uses
# Handshake packets to send subsequent cryptographic handshake messages
# and acknowledgments to the server.
# 
# The Destination Connection ID field in a Handshake packet contains a
# connection ID that is chosen by the recipient of the packet; the
# Source Connection ID includes the connection ID that the sender of
# the packet wishes to use; see Section 7.2.
# 
# Handshake packets have their own packet number space, and thus the
# first Handshake packet sent by a server contains a packet number of
# 0.
# 
# The payload of this packet contains CRYPTO frames and could contain
# PING, PADDING, or ACK frames.  Handshake packets MAY contain
# CONNECTION_CLOSE frames of type 0x1c.  Endpoints MUST treat receipt
# of Handshake packets with other frames as a connection error of type
# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# Like Initial packets (see Section 17.2.2.1), data in CRYPTO frames
# for Handshake packets is discarded -- and no longer retransmitted --
# when Handshake protection keys are discarded.
