# 10.2.1.  Closing Connection State
#
# An endpoint enters the closing state after initiating an immediate
# close.
# 
# In the closing state, an endpoint retains only enough information to
# generate a packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame and to identify
# packets as belonging to the connection.  An endpoint in the closing
# state sends a packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in response
# to any incoming packet that it attributes to the connection.
# 
# An endpoint SHOULD limit the rate at which it generates packets in
# the closing state.  For instance, an endpoint could wait for a
# progressively increasing number of received packets or amount of time
# before responding to received packets.
# 
# An endpoint's selected connection ID and the QUIC version are
# sufficient information to identify packets for a closing connection;
# the endpoint MAY discard all other connection state.  An endpoint
# that is closing is not required to process any received frame.  An
# endpoint MAY retain packet protection keys for incoming packets to
# allow it to read and process a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.
# 
# An endpoint MAY drop packet protection keys when entering the closing
# state and send a packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in
# response to any UDP datagram that is received.  However, an endpoint
# that discards packet protection keys cannot identify and discard
# invalid packets.  To avoid being used for an amplification attack,
# such endpoints MUST limit the cumulative size of packets it sends to
# three times the cumulative size of the packets that are received and
# attributed to the connection.  To minimize the state that an endpoint
# maintains for a closing connection, endpoints MAY send the exact same
# packet in response to any received packet.
# 
#    |  Note: Allowing retransmission of a closing packet is an
#    |  exception to the requirement that a new packet number be used
#    |  for each packet; see Section 12.3.  Sending new packet numbers
#    |  is primarily of advantage to loss recovery and congestion
#    |  control, which are not expected to be relevant for a closed
#    |  connection.  Retransmitting the final packet requires less
#    |  state.
# 
# While in the closing state, an endpoint could receive packets from a
# new source address, possibly indicating a connection migration; see
# Section 9.  An endpoint in the closing state MUST either discard
# packets received from an unvalidated address or limit the cumulative
# size of packets it sends to an unvalidated address to three times the
# size of packets it receives from that address.
# 
# An endpoint is not expected to handle key updates when it is closing
# (Section 6 of [QUIC-TLS]).  A key update might prevent the endpoint
# from moving from the closing state to the draining state, as the
# endpoint will not be able to process subsequently received packets,
# but it otherwise has no impact.
