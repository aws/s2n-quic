# 15.  Versions
#
# QUIC versions are identified using a 32-bit unsigned number.
# 
# The version 0x00000000 is reserved to represent version negotiation.
# This version of the specification is identified by the number
# 0x00000001.
# 
# Other versions of QUIC might have different properties from this
# version.  The properties of QUIC that are guaranteed to be consistent
# across all versions of the protocol are described in
# [QUIC-INVARIANTS].
# 
# Version 0x00000001 of QUIC uses TLS as a cryptographic handshake
# protocol, as described in [QUIC-TLS].
# 
# Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the version number
# cleared are reserved for use in future IETF consensus documents.
# 
# Versions that follow the pattern 0x?a?a?a?a are reserved for use in
# forcing version negotiation to be exercised -- that is, any version
# number where the low four bits of all bytes is 1010 (in binary).  A
# client or server MAY advertise support for any of these reserved
# versions.
# 
# Reserved version numbers will never represent a real protocol; a
# client MAY use one of these version numbers with the expectation that
# the server will initiate version negotiation; a server MAY advertise
# support for one of these versions and can expect that clients ignore
# the value.
