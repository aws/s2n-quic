# 6.  Version Negotiation
#
# Version negotiation allows a server to indicate that it does not
# support the version the client used.  A server sends a Version
# Negotiation packet in response to each packet that might initiate a
# new connection; see Section 5.2 for details.
# 
# The size of the first packet sent by a client will determine whether
# a server sends a Version Negotiation packet.  Clients that support
# multiple QUIC versions SHOULD ensure that the first UDP datagram they
# send is sized to the largest of the minimum datagram sizes from all
# versions they support, using PADDING frames (Section 19.1) as
# necessary.  This ensures that the server responds if there is a
# mutually supported version.  A server might not send a Version
# Negotiation packet if the datagram it receives is smaller than the
# minimum size specified in a different version; see Section 14.1.
