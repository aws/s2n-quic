# 
#                  Figure 13: Long Header Packet Format
# 
# Long headers are used for packets that are sent prior to the
# establishment of 1-RTT keys.  Once 1-RTT keys are available, a sender
# switches to sending packets using the short header (Section 17.3).
# The long form allows for special packets -- such as the Version
# Negotiation packet -- to be represented in this uniform fixed-length
# packet format.  Packets that use the long header contain the
# following fields:
# 
# Header Form:  The most significant bit (0x80) of byte 0 (the first
#    byte) is set to 1 for long headers.
# 
# Fixed Bit:  The next bit (0x40) of byte 0 is set to 1, unless the
#    packet is a Version Negotiation packet.  Packets containing a zero
#    value for this bit are not valid packets in this version and MUST
#    be discarded.  A value of 1 for this bit allows QUIC to coexist
#    with other protocols; see [RFC7983].
# 
# Long Packet Type:  The next two bits (those with a mask of 0x30) of
#    byte 0 contain a packet type.  Packet types are listed in Table 5.
# 
# Type-Specific Bits:  The semantics of the lower four bits (those with
#    a mask of 0x0f) of byte 0 are determined by the packet type.
# 
# Version:  The QUIC Version is a 32-bit field that follows the first
#    byte.  This field indicates the version of QUIC that is in use and
#    determines how the rest of the protocol fields are interpreted.
# 
# Destination Connection ID Length:  The byte following the version
#    contains the length in bytes of the Destination Connection ID
#    field that follows it.  This length is encoded as an 8-bit
#    unsigned integer.  In QUIC version 1, this value MUST NOT exceed
#    20 bytes.  Endpoints that receive a version 1 long header with a
#    value larger than 20 MUST drop the packet.  In order to properly
#    form a Version Negotiation packet, servers SHOULD be able to read
#    longer connection IDs from other QUIC versions.
# 
# Destination Connection ID:  The Destination Connection ID field
#    follows the Destination Connection ID Length field, which
#    indicates the length of this field.  Section 7.2 describes the use
#    of this field in more detail.
# 
# Source Connection ID Length:  The byte following the Destination
#    Connection ID contains the length in bytes of the Source
#    Connection ID field that follows it.  This length is encoded as an
#    8-bit unsigned integer.  In QUIC version 1, this value MUST NOT
#    exceed 20 bytes.  Endpoints that receive a version 1 long header
#    with a value larger than 20 MUST drop the packet.  In order to
#    properly form a Version Negotiation packet, servers SHOULD be able
#    to read longer connection IDs from other QUIC versions.
# 
# Source Connection ID:  The Source Connection ID field follows the
#    Source Connection ID Length field, which indicates the length of
#    this field.  Section 7.2 describes the use of this field in more
#    detail.
# 
# Type-Specific Payload:  The remainder of the packet, if any, is type
#    specific.
# 
# In this version of QUIC, the following packet types with the long
# header are defined:
# 
#                 +======+===========+================+
#                 | Type | Name      | Section        |
#                 +======+===========+================+
#                 | 0x00 | Initial   | Section 17.2.2 |
#                 +------+-----------+----------------+
#                 | 0x01 | 0-RTT     | Section 17.2.3 |
#                 +------+-----------+----------------+
#                 | 0x02 | Handshake | Section 17.2.4 |
#                 +------+-----------+----------------+
#                 | 0x03 | Retry     | Section 17.2.5 |
#                 +------+-----------+----------------+
# 
#                   Table 5: Long Header Packet Types
# 
# The header form bit, Destination and Source Connection ID lengths,
# Destination and Source Connection ID fields, and Version fields of a
# long header packet are version independent.  The other fields in the
# first byte are version specific.  See [QUIC-INVARIANTS] for details
# on how packets from different versions of QUIC are interpreted.
# 
# The interpretation of the fields and the payload are specific to a
# version and packet type.  While type-specific semantics for this
# version are described in the following sections, several long header
# packets in this version of QUIC contain these additional fields:
# 
# Reserved Bits:  Two bits (those with a mask of 0x0c) of byte 0 are
#    reserved across multiple packet types.  These bits are protected
#    using header protection; see Section 5.4 of [QUIC-TLS].  The value
#    included prior to protection MUST be set to 0.  An endpoint MUST
#    treat receipt of a packet that has a non-zero value for these bits
#    after removing both packet and header protection as a connection
#    error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.  Discarding such a packet after
#    only removing header protection can expose the endpoint to
#    attacks; see Section 9.5 of [QUIC-TLS].
# 
# Packet Number Length:  In packet types that contain a Packet Number
#    field, the least significant two bits (those with a mask of 0x03)
#    of byte 0 contain the length of the Packet Number field, encoded
#    as an unsigned two-bit integer that is one less than the length of
#    the Packet Number field in bytes.  That is, the length of the
#    Packet Number field is the value of this field plus one.  These
#    bits are protected using header protection; see Section 5.4 of
#    [QUIC-TLS].
# 
# Length:  This is the length of the remainder of the packet (that is,
#    the Packet Number and Payload fields) in bytes, encoded as a
#    variable-length integer (Section 16).
# 
# Packet Number:  This field is 1 to 4 bytes long.  The packet number
#    is protected using header protection; see Section 5.4 of
#    [QUIC-TLS].  The length of the Packet Number field is encoded in
#    the Packet Number Length bits of byte 0; see above.
# 
# Packet Payload:  This is the payload of the packet -- containing a
#    sequence of frames -- that is protected using packet protection.
