# 6.3.  Using Reserved Versions
#
# For a server to use a new version in the future, clients need to
# correctly handle unsupported versions.  Some version numbers
# (0x?a?a?a?a, as defined in Section 15) are reserved for inclusion in
# fields that contain version numbers.
# 
# Endpoints MAY add reserved versions to any field where unknown or
# unsupported versions are ignored to test that a peer correctly
# ignores the value.  For instance, an endpoint could include a
# reserved version in a Version Negotiation packet; see Section 17.2.1.
# Endpoints MAY send packets with a reserved version to test that a
# peer correctly discards the packet.
