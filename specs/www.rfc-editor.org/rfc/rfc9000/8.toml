# 8.  Address Validation
#
# Address validation ensures that an endpoint cannot be used for a
# traffic amplification attack.  In such an attack, a packet is sent to
# a server with spoofed source address information that identifies a
# victim.  If a server generates more or larger packets in response to
# that packet, the attacker can use the server to send more data toward
# the victim than it would be able to send on its own.
# 
# The primary defense against amplification attacks is verifying that a
# peer is able to receive packets at the transport address that it
# claims.  Therefore, after receiving packets from an address that is
# not yet validated, an endpoint MUST limit the amount of data it sends
# to the unvalidated address to three times the amount of data received
# from that address.  This limit on the size of responses is known as
# the anti-amplification limit.
# 
# Address validation is performed both during connection establishment
# (see Section 8.1) and during connection migration (see Section 8.2).
