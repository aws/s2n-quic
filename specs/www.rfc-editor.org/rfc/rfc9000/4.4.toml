# 4.4.  Handling Stream Cancellation
#
# Endpoints need to eventually agree on the amount of flow control
# credit that has been consumed on every stream, to be able to account
# for all bytes for connection-level flow control.
# 
# On receipt of a RESET_STREAM frame, an endpoint will tear down state
# for the matching stream and ignore further data arriving on that
# stream.
# 
# RESET_STREAM terminates one direction of a stream abruptly.  For a
# bidirectional stream, RESET_STREAM has no effect on data flow in the
# opposite direction.  Both endpoints MUST maintain flow control state
# for the stream in the unterminated direction until that direction
# enters a terminal state.
