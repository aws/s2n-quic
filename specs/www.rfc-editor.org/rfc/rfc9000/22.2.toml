# 22.2.  QUIC Versions Registry
#
# IANA has added a registry for "QUIC Versions" under a "QUIC" heading.
# 
# The "QUIC Versions" registry governs a 32-bit space; see Section 15.
# This registry follows the registration policy from Section 22.1.
# Permanent registrations in this registry are assigned using the
# Specification Required policy (Section 4.6 of [RFC8126]).
# 
# The codepoint of 0x00000001 for the protocol is assigned with
# permanent status to the protocol defined in this document.  The
# codepoint of 0x00000000 is permanently reserved; the note for this
# codepoint indicates that this version is reserved for version
# negotiation.
# 
# All codepoints that follow the pattern 0x?a?a?a?a are reserved, MUST
# NOT be assigned by IANA, and MUST NOT appear in the listing of
# assigned values.
