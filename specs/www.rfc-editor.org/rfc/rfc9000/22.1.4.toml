# 22.1.4.  Permanent Registrations
#
# Permanent registrations in QUIC registries use the Specification
# Required policy (Section 4.6 of [RFC8126]), unless otherwise
# specified.  The designated expert or experts verify that a
# specification exists and is readily accessible.  Experts are
# encouraged to be biased towards approving registrations unless they
# are abusive, frivolous, or actively harmful (not merely aesthetically
# displeasing or architecturally dubious).  The creation of a registry
# MAY specify additional constraints on permanent registrations.
# 
# The creation of a registry MAY identify a range of codepoints where
# registrations are governed by a different registration policy.  For
# instance, the "QUIC Frame Types" registry (Section 22.4) has a
# stricter policy for codepoints in the range from 0 to 63.
# 
# Any stricter requirements for permanent registrations do not prevent
# provisional registrations for affected codepoints.  For instance, a
# provisional registration for a frame type of 61 could be requested.
# 
# All registrations made by Standards Track publications MUST be
# permanent.
# 
# All registrations in this document are assigned a permanent status
# and list a change controller of the IETF and a contact of the QUIC
# Working Group (quic@ietf.org).
