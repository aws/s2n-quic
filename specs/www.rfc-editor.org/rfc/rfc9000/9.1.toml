# 9.1.  Probing a New Path
#
# An endpoint MAY probe for peer reachability from a new local address
# using path validation (Section 8.2) prior to migrating the connection
# to the new local address.  Failure of path validation simply means
# that the new path is not usable for this connection.  Failure to
# validate a path does not cause the connection to end unless there are
# no valid alternative paths available.
# 
# PATH_CHALLENGE, PATH_RESPONSE, NEW_CONNECTION_ID, and PADDING frames
# are "probing frames", and all other frames are "non-probing frames".
# A packet containing only probing frames is a "probing packet", and a
# packet containing any other frame is a "non-probing packet".
