# 9.6.1.  Communicating a Preferred Address
#
# A server conveys a preferred address by including the
# preferred_address transport parameter in the TLS handshake.
# 
# Servers MAY communicate a preferred address of each address family
# (IPv4 and IPv6) to allow clients to pick the one most suited to their
# network attachment.
# 
# Once the handshake is confirmed, the client SHOULD select one of the
# two addresses provided by the server and initiate path validation
# (see Section 8.2).  A client constructs packets using any previously
# unused active connection ID, taken from either the preferred_address
# transport parameter or a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.
# 
# As soon as path validation succeeds, the client SHOULD begin sending
# all future packets to the new server address using the new connection
# ID and discontinue use of the old server address.  If path validation
# fails, the client MUST continue sending all future packets to the
# server's original IP address.
