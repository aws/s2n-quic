# 17.2.5.  Retry Packet
#
# As shown in Figure 18, a Retry packet uses a long packet header with
# a type value of 0x03.  It carries an address validation token created
# by the server.  It is used by a server that wishes to perform a
# retry; see Section 8.1.
# 
# Retry Packet {
#   Header Form (1) = 1,
#   Fixed Bit (1) = 1,
#   Long Packet Type (2) = 3,
#   Unused (4),
#   Version (32),
#   Destination Connection ID Length (8),
#   Destination Connection ID (0..160),
#   Source Connection ID Length (8),
#   Source Connection ID (0..160),
#   Retry Token (..),
#   Retry Integrity Tag (128),
# }
# 
#                        Figure 18: Retry Packet
# 
# A Retry packet does not contain any protected fields.  The value in
# the Unused field is set to an arbitrary value by the server; a client
# MUST ignore these bits.  In addition to the fields from the long
# header, it contains these additional fields:
# 
# Retry Token:  An opaque token that the server can use to validate the
#    client's address.
# 
# Retry Integrity Tag:  Defined in Section 5.8 ("Retry Packet
#    Integrity") of [QUIC-TLS].
