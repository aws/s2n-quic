# 17.4.  Latency Spin Bit
#
# The latency spin bit, which is defined for 1-RTT packets
# (Section 17.3.1), enables passive latency monitoring from observation
# points on the network path throughout the duration of a connection.
# The server reflects the spin value received, while the client "spins"
# it after one RTT.  On-path observers can measure the time between two
# spin bit toggle events to estimate the end-to-end RTT of a
# connection.
# 
# The spin bit is only present in 1-RTT packets, since it is possible
# to measure the initial RTT of a connection by observing the
# handshake.  Therefore, the spin bit is available after version
# negotiation and connection establishment are completed.  On-path
# measurement and use of the latency spin bit are further discussed in
# [QUIC-MANAGEABILITY].
# 
# The spin bit is an OPTIONAL feature of this version of QUIC.  An
# endpoint that does not support this feature MUST disable it, as
# defined below.
# 
# Each endpoint unilaterally decides if the spin bit is enabled or
# disabled for a connection.  Implementations MUST allow administrators
# of clients and servers to disable the spin bit either globally or on
# a per-connection basis.  Even when the spin bit is not disabled by
# the administrator, endpoints MUST disable their use of the spin bit
# for a random selection of at least one in every 16 network paths, or
# for one in every 16 connection IDs, in order to ensure that QUIC
# connections that disable the spin bit are commonly observed on the
# network.  As each endpoint disables the spin bit independently, this
# ensures that the spin bit signal is disabled on approximately one in
# eight network paths.
# 
# When the spin bit is disabled, endpoints MAY set the spin bit to any
# value and MUST ignore any incoming value.  It is RECOMMENDED that
# endpoints set the spin bit to a random value either chosen
# independently for each packet or chosen independently for each
# connection ID.
# 
# If the spin bit is enabled for the connection, the endpoint maintains
# a spin value for each network path and sets the spin bit in the
# packet header to the currently stored value when a 1-RTT packet is
# sent on that path.  The spin value is initialized to 0 in the
# endpoint for each network path.  Each endpoint also remembers the
# highest packet number seen from its peer on each path.
# 
# When a server receives a 1-RTT packet that increases the highest
# packet number seen by the server from the client on a given network
# path, it sets the spin value for that path to be equal to the spin
# bit in the received packet.
# 
# When a client receives a 1-RTT packet that increases the highest
# packet number seen by the client from the server on a given network
# path, it sets the spin value for that path to the inverse of the spin
# bit in the received packet.
# 
# An endpoint resets the spin value for a network path to 0 when
# changing the connection ID being used on that network path.
