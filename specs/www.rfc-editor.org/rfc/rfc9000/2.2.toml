# 2.2.  Sending and Receiving Data
#
# STREAM frames (Section 19.8) encapsulate data sent by an application.
# An endpoint uses the Stream ID and Offset fields in STREAM frames to
# place data in order.
# 
# Endpoints MUST be able to deliver stream data to an application as an
# ordered byte stream.  Delivering an ordered byte stream requires that
# an endpoint buffer any data that is received out of order, up to the
# advertised flow control limit.
# 
# QUIC makes no specific allowances for delivery of stream data out of
# order.  However, implementations MAY choose to offer the ability to
# deliver data out of order to a receiving application.
# 
# An endpoint could receive data for a stream at the same stream offset
# multiple times.  Data that has already been received can be
# discarded.  The data at a given offset MUST NOT change if it is sent
# multiple times; an endpoint MAY treat receipt of different data at
# the same offset within a stream as a connection error of type
# PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.
# 
# Streams are an ordered byte-stream abstraction with no other
# structure visible to QUIC.  STREAM frame boundaries are not expected
# to be preserved when data is transmitted, retransmitted after packet
# loss, or delivered to the application at a receiver.
# 
# An endpoint MUST NOT send data on any stream without ensuring that it
# is within the flow control limits set by its peer.  Flow control is
# described in detail in Section 4.
