# 4.  Flow Control
#
# Receivers need to limit the amount of data that they are required to
# buffer, in order to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming them or a
# malicious sender from consuming a large amount of memory.  To enable
# a receiver to limit memory commitments for a connection, streams are
# flow controlled both individually and across a connection as a whole.
# A QUIC receiver controls the maximum amount of data the sender can
# send on a stream as well as across all streams at any time, as
# described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
# 
# Similarly, to limit concurrency within a connection, a QUIC endpoint
# controls the maximum cumulative number of streams that its peer can
# initiate, as described in Section 4.6.
# 
# Data sent in CRYPTO frames is not flow controlled in the same way as
# stream data.  QUIC relies on the cryptographic protocol
# implementation to avoid excessive buffering of data; see [QUIC-TLS].
# To avoid excessive buffering at multiple layers, QUIC implementations
# SHOULD provide an interface for the cryptographic protocol
# implementation to communicate its buffering limits.
