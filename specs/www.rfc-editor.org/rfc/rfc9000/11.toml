# 11.  Error Handling
#
# An endpoint that detects an error SHOULD signal the existence of that
# error to its peer.  Both transport-level and application-level errors
# can affect an entire connection; see Section 11.1.  Only application-
# level errors can be isolated to a single stream; see Section 11.2.
# 
# The most appropriate error code (Section 20) SHOULD be included in
# the frame that signals the error.  Where this specification
# identifies error conditions, it also identifies the error code that
# is used; though these are worded as requirements, different
# implementation strategies might lead to different errors being
# reported.  In particular, an endpoint MAY use any applicable error
# code when it detects an error condition; a generic error code (such
# as PROTOCOL_VIOLATION or INTERNAL_ERROR) can always be used in place
# of specific error codes.
# 
# A stateless reset (Section 10.3) is not suitable for any error that
# can be signaled with a CONNECTION_CLOSE or RESET_STREAM frame.  A
# stateless reset MUST NOT be used by an endpoint that has the state
# necessary to send a frame on the connection.
