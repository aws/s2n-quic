# 9.3.3.  Off-Path Packet Forwarding
#
# An off-path attacker that can observe packets might forward copies of
# genuine packets to endpoints.  If the copied packet arrives before
# the genuine packet, this will appear as a NAT rebinding.  Any genuine
# packet will be discarded as a duplicate.  If the attacker is able to
# continue forwarding packets, it might be able to cause migration to a
# path via the attacker.  This places the attacker on-path, giving it
# the ability to observe or drop all subsequent packets.
# 
# This style of attack relies on the attacker using a path that has
# approximately the same characteristics as the direct path between
# endpoints.  The attack is more reliable if relatively few packets are
# sent or if packet loss coincides with the attempted attack.
# 
# A non-probing packet received on the original path that increases the
# maximum received packet number will cause the endpoint to move back
# to that path.  Eliciting packets on this path increases the
# likelihood that the attack is unsuccessful.  Therefore, mitigation of
# this attack relies on triggering the exchange of packets.
# 
# In response to an apparent migration, endpoints MUST validate the
# previously active path using a PATH_CHALLENGE frame.  This induces
# the sending of new packets on that path.  If the path is no longer
# viable, the validation attempt will time out and fail; if the path is
# viable but no longer desired, the validation will succeed but only
# results in probing packets being sent on the path.
# 
# An endpoint that receives a PATH_CHALLENGE on an active path SHOULD
# send a non-probing packet in response.  If the non-probing packet
# arrives before any copy made by an attacker, this results in the
# connection being migrated back to the original path.  Any subsequent
# migration to another path restarts this entire process.
# 
# This defense is imperfect, but this is not considered a serious
# problem.  If the path via the attack is reliably faster than the
# original path despite multiple attempts to use that original path, it
# is not possible to distinguish between an attack and an improvement
# in routing.
# 
# An endpoint could also use heuristics to improve detection of this
# style of attack.  For instance, NAT rebinding is improbable if
# packets were recently received on the old path; similarly, rebinding
# is rare on IPv6 paths.  Endpoints can also look for duplicated
# packets.  Conversely, a change in connection ID is more likely to
# indicate an intentional migration rather than an attack.
