# 13.4.2.  ECN Validation
#
# It is possible for faulty network devices to corrupt or erroneously
# drop packets that carry a non-zero ECN codepoint.  To ensure
# connectivity in the presence of such devices, an endpoint validates
# the ECN counts for each network path and disables the use of ECN on
# that path if errors are detected.
# 
# To perform ECN validation for a new path:
# 
# *  The endpoint sets an ECT(0) codepoint in the IP header of early
#    outgoing packets sent on a new path to the peer [RFC8311].
# 
# *  The endpoint monitors whether all packets sent with an ECT
#    codepoint are eventually deemed lost (Section 6 of
#    [QUIC-RECOVERY]), indicating that ECN validation has failed.
# 
# If an endpoint has cause to expect that IP packets with an ECT
# codepoint might be dropped by a faulty network element, the endpoint
# could set an ECT codepoint for only the first ten outgoing packets on
# a path, or for a period of three PTOs (see Section 6.2 of
# [QUIC-RECOVERY]).  If all packets marked with non-zero ECN codepoints
# are subsequently lost, it can disable marking on the assumption that
# the marking caused the loss.
# 
# An endpoint thus attempts to use ECN and validates this for each new
# connection, when switching to a server's preferred address, and on
# active connection migration to a new path.  Appendix A.4 describes
# one possible algorithm.
# 
# Other methods of probing paths for ECN support are possible, as are
# different marking strategies.  Implementations MAY use other methods
# defined in RFCs; see [RFC8311].  Implementations that use the ECT(1)
# codepoint need to perform ECN validation using the reported ECT(1)
# counts.
