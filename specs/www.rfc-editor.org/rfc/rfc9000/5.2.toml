# 5.2.  Matching Packets to Connections
#
# Incoming packets are classified on receipt.  Packets can either be
# associated with an existing connection or -- for servers --
# potentially create a new connection.
# 
# Endpoints try to associate a packet with an existing connection.  If
# the packet has a non-zero-length Destination Connection ID
# corresponding to an existing connection, QUIC processes that packet
# accordingly.  Note that more than one connection ID can be associated
# with a connection; see Section 5.1.
# 
# If the Destination Connection ID is zero length and the addressing
# information in the packet matches the addressing information the
# endpoint uses to identify a connection with a zero-length connection
# ID, QUIC processes the packet as part of that connection.  An
# endpoint can use just destination IP and port or both source and
# destination addresses for identification, though this makes
# connections fragile as described in Section 5.1.
# 
# Endpoints can send a Stateless Reset (Section 10.3) for any packets
# that cannot be attributed to an existing connection.  A Stateless
# Reset allows a peer to more quickly identify when a connection
# becomes unusable.
# 
# Packets that are matched to an existing connection are discarded if
# the packets are inconsistent with the state of that connection.  For
# example, packets are discarded if they indicate a different protocol
# version than that of the connection or if the removal of packet
# protection is unsuccessful once the expected keys are available.
# 
# Invalid packets that lack strong integrity protection, such as
# Initial, Retry, or Version Negotiation, MAY be discarded.  An
# endpoint MUST generate a connection error if processing the contents
# of these packets prior to discovering an error, or fully revert any
# changes made during that processing.
