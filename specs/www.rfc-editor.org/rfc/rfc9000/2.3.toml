# 2.3.  Stream Prioritization
#
# Stream multiplexing can have a significant effect on application
# performance if resources allocated to streams are correctly
# prioritized.
# 
# QUIC does not provide a mechanism for exchanging prioritization
# information.  Instead, it relies on receiving priority information
# from the application.
# 
# A QUIC implementation SHOULD provide ways in which an application can
# indicate the relative priority of streams.  An implementation uses
# information provided by the application to determine how to allocate
# resources to active streams.
