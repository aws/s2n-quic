# 19.14.  STREAMS_BLOCKED Frames
#
# A sender SHOULD send a STREAMS_BLOCKED frame (type=0x16 or 0x17) when
# it wishes to open a stream but is unable to do so due to the maximum
# stream limit set by its peer; see Section 19.11.  A STREAMS_BLOCKED
# frame of type 0x16 is used to indicate reaching the bidirectional
# stream limit, and a STREAMS_BLOCKED frame of type 0x17 is used to
# indicate reaching the unidirectional stream limit.
# 
# A STREAMS_BLOCKED frame does not open the stream, but informs the
# peer that a new stream was needed and the stream limit prevented the
# creation of the stream.
# 
# STREAMS_BLOCKED frames are formatted as shown in Figure 38.
# 
# STREAMS_BLOCKED Frame {
#   Type (i) = 0x16..0x17,
#   Maximum Streams (i),
# }
# 
#                Figure 38: STREAMS_BLOCKED Frame Format
# 
# STREAMS_BLOCKED frames contain the following field:
# 
# Maximum Streams:  A variable-length integer indicating the maximum
#    number of streams allowed at the time the frame was sent.  This
#    value cannot exceed 2^60, as it is not possible to encode stream
#    IDs larger than 2^62-1.  Receipt of a frame that encodes a larger
#    stream ID MUST be treated as a connection error of type
#    STREAM_LIMIT_ERROR or FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.
