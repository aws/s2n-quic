Endpoints responding to an apparent key update MUST NOT generate a

was invalid (see Section 9.4).

An endpoint MAY
perform this process as part of packet processing, but this creates a
timing signal that can be used by an attacker to learn when key
updates happen and thus the value of the Key Phase bit in certain
packets.

Endpoints MAY instead defer the creation of the next set of
receive packet protection keys until some time after a key update
completes, up to three times the PTO; see Section 6.5.

Once generated, the next set of packet protection keys SHOULD be

discarded.

For this reason, endpoints MUST be able to retain two sets of packet
protection keys for receiving packets: the current and the next.
